  Welcome to Figma, the world's first collaborative interface design tool. Figma
  allows designers to create and prototype their digital experiences - together
  in real-time and in one place - helping them turn their ideas and visions into
  products, faster. Figma's mission is to make design accessible to everyone.
  The Figma API is one of the ways we aim to do that.
