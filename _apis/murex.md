      MX.3 offers a differentiating alternative to traditional investment
      management software for those asset managers, insurance companies, pension
      funds and hedge funds eager to diversify their product mix beyond cash
      settled securities, implement both standard and sophisticated compliance
      policies, value their derivatives position independently, and push the
      modelling of LDI to the next level by including inflation and equity risk
      factors, use superior risk modeling and performance analysis, tightly
      integrated to the investment decision cycle.
