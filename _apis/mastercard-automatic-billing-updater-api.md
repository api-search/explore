name: Mastercard Automatic Billing Updater API
description: >-
  Automatic Billing Updater (ABU) is a web service that provides access to
  updated account credentials (cards). This can be leveraged by
  Merchant/Acquirers/Payment Service Providers to ensure that they always have
  their customers’ most up to date card credentials on file; the main benefit
  being a big reduction in declines for recurring and card-on-file payments.
  This service can be used in two different ways, either pulling updates or
  having updates pushed to an endpoint on the Merchant/Acquirers/Payment Service
  Provider’s system for account numbers that they are watching.
