description: >-
  The Historical Weather API allows you to quickly retrieve accurate, high
  resolution historical weather data for any location in the world. Our curated
  weather data is backed by over 120,000 weather stations as well as high
  resolution gridded weather datasets such as the ERA-5 re-analysis, and global
  satellite / doppler radar. Data retrieved from our API is gap-free (minimal
  missing data) due to its application of advanced machine learning, and
  statistical backfilling techniques.
