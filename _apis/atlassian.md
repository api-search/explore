                  A dashboard item enables an app to add user-specific

                  Evaluates a Jira expression and returns its value.


                  This resource can be used to test Jira expressions that you
                  plan to use elsewhere, or to fetch data in a flexible way.
                  Consult the [Jira expressions
                  documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/)
                  for more details.


                  #### Context variables ####


                  The following context variables are available to Jira
                  expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends
                  on various factors; usually you need to manually request them
                  in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them
                  are added automatically under certain conditions.

                   *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
                   *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
                   *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.

                  Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request
                  with their types. Those variables can be accessed by key in
                  the Jira expression. These variable types are available for
                  use in a custom context:

                   *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.
                   *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
                   *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
                   *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.

                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an
                  expression may return different results for different users
                  depending on their permissions. For example, different users
                  may see different comments on the same issue.  

                  Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira
                  Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields
                  (for example, `issue.sprint`).

                   *  For all other fields, this operation only returns the fields that the user has permission to view (that is, the field is used in at least one project that the user has *Browse Projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for.)

                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

                  string is used:

                   *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
                   *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.

                  For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the
                  display name *Tina*, email address

                      If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.

                  The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira
                  expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/).
                  Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when
                  applied to a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with
                  the
                  [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions)
                  that apply to all Jira expressions.


                  The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.


                  The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these
                  criteria:

                   *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
                   *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.
                   *  `hasProperty`:
                      
                       *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.
                       *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.

                  If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with
                  the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are
                  eligible.


                  If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is
                  returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and
                  `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because
                  without the property the property cannot have a value).


                  The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues
                  visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES
                  permission for the issue are considered eligible.

                  Tip: Use a client library. Many client libraries have classes
                  for handling multipart POST operations. For example, in Java,
                  the Apache HTTP Components library provides a
                  [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html)
                  class for multipart POST operations.

                  Returns the edit screen fields for an issue that are visible

                  the requests in [Edit
                  issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-put).


                  This endpoint will check for these conditions:


                  1.  Field is available on a field screen - through screen,
                  screen scheme, issue type screen scheme, and issue type scheme
                  configuration. `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this
                  condition.

                  2.  Field is visible in the [field
                  configuration](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/change-a-field-configuration/).
                  `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this condition.

                  3.  Field is shown on the issue: each field has different
                  conditions here. For example: Attachment field only shows if
                  attachments are enabled. Assignee only shows if user has
                  permissions to assign the issue.

                  4.  If a field is custom then it must have valid custom field
                  context, applicable for its project and issue type. All system
                  fields are assumed to have context in all projects and all
                  issue types.

                  5.  Issue has a project, issue type, and status defined.

                  6.  Issue is assigned to a valid workflow, and the current
                  status has assigned a workflow step.
                  `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this condition.

                  7.  The current workflow step is editable. This is true by
                  default, but [can be disabled by
                  setting](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
                  the `jira.issue.editable` property to `false`.
                  `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this condition.

                  8.  User has [Edit issues
                  permission](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/).

                  9.  Workflow permissions allow editing a field. This is true
                  by default but [can be
                  modified](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
                  using `jira.permission.*` workflow properties.


                  Fields hidden using [Issue layout settings
                  page](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view/)

                  Loads an avatar for the issue type.


                  Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the
                  request. Also, include the following headers:

                   *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
                   *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

                  For example:  

                  `curl --request POST \ --user email@example.com:<api_token> \
                  --header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' \ --header
                  'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' \ --data-binary
                  "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" \ --url
                  'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issuetype/{issueTypeId}'This`


                  The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are
                  specified, the square originates at the top left of the image.
                  The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the
                  height or width of the image.


                  The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16,
                  24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


                  After creating the avatar, use [ Update issue
                  type](#api-rest-api-3-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue
                  type's displayed avatar.

                  Sanitizes one or more JQL queries by converting readable
                  details into IDs where a user doesn't have permission to view
                  the entity.


                  For example, if the query contains the clause *project =
                  'Secret project'*, and a user does not have browse permission
                  for the project "Secret project", the sanitized query replaces
                  the clause with *project = 12345"* (where 12345 is the ID of
                  the project). If a user has the required permission, the
                  clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is null, sanitizing
                  is performed for an anonymous user.


                  Note that sanitization doesn't make the queries
                  GDPR-compliant, because it doesn't remove user identifiers
                  (username or user key). If you need to make queries
                  GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account IDs

                  queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).


                  Before sanitization each JQL query is parsed. The queries are
                  returned in the same order that they were passed.

                  user has. Details of the user's permissions can be obtained in
                  a global, project, issue or comment context.


                  The user is reported as having a project permission:

                   *  in the global context, if the user has the project permission in any project.
                   *  for a project, where the project permission is determined using issue data, if the user meets the permission's criteria for any issue in the project. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project.
                   *  for an issue, where a project permission is determined using issue data, if the user has the permission in the issue. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project containing the issue.
                   *  for a comment, where the user has both the permission to browse the comment and the project permission for the comment's parent issue. Only the BROWSE\_PROJECTS permission is supported. If a `commentId` is provided whose `permissions` does not equal BROWSE\_PROJECTS, a 400 error will be returned.

                  This means that users may be shown as having an issue
                  permission (such as EDIT\_ISSUES) in the global context or a
                  project context but may not have the permission for any or all
                  issues. For example, if Reporters have the EDIT\_ISSUES
                  permission a user would be shown as having this permission in
                  the global context or the context of a project, because any
                  user can be a reporter. However, if they are not the user who
                  reported the issue queried they would not have EDIT\_ISSUES
                  permission for that issue.


                  Global permissions are unaffected by context.

                  locale instead.

                  Creates a preference for the user or updates a preference's
                  value by sending a plain text string. For example, `false`. An
                  arbitrary preference can be created with the value containing
                  up to 255 characters. In addition, the following keys define
                  system preferences that can be set or created:

                   *  *user.notifications.mimetype* The mime type used in notifications sent to the user. Defaults to `html`.
                   *  *user.default.share.private* Whether new [ filters](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/eQiiLQ) are set to private. Defaults to `true`.

                   *  *user.autowatch.disabled* Whether the user automatically watches issues they create or add a comment to. By default, not set: the user takes the instance autowatch setting.

                  Note that these keys are deprecated:

                   *  *jira.user.locale* The locale of the user. By default, not set. The user takes the instance locale.
                   *  *jira.user.timezone* The time zone of the user. By default, not set. The user takes the instance timezone.

                  These system preferences keys will be deprecated by

                  ### About permission schemes and grants ###


                  A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A
                  permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.


                  #### Holder object ####


                  The `holder` object contains information about the user or
                  group being granted the permission. For example, the
                  *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named
                  *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is
                  `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name,
                  `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"` and the value
                  is group ID, `"value":
                  "ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f"`.


                  The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

                   *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
                   *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
                   *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`

                  The following `types` are available. The expected values for
                  `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types
                  may not have a `parameter` or `value`):

                   *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
                   *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
                   *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
                   *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).
                   *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).
                   *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
                   *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).
                   *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
                   *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
                   *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).
                   *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).

                  #### Built-in permissions ####


                  The [built-in Jira
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are
                  listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the
                  [project
                  permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/)

                  Updates a permission scheme. Below are some important things
                  to note when using this resource:

                   *  If a permissions list is present in the request, then it is set in the permission scheme, overwriting *all existing* grants.
                   *  If you want to update only the name and description, then do not send a permissions list in the request.
                   *  Sending an empty list will remove all permission grants from the permission scheme.

                  If you want to add or delete a permission grant instead of
                  updating the whole list, see [Create permission
                  grant](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-post)

                  Loads an avatar for a project.


                  Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the
                  request. Also, include the following headers:

                   *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
                   *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

                  For example:  

                  `curl --request POST `


                  `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


                  `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


                  `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


                  `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


                  `--url
                  'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/{projectIdOrKey}/avatar2'`


                  The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are
                  specified, the square originates at the top left of the image.
                  The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the
                  height or width of the image.


                  The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16,
                  24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


                  After creating the avatar use [Set project
                  avatar](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to
                  set it as the project's displayed avatar.

                  ### About project roles ###


                  [Project
                  roles](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/)
                  are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with
                  projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared
                  globally with all projects, but each project can have a
                  different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups,
                  which have the same membership throughout all Jira
                  applications).


                  Project roles are used in [permission
                  schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email
                  notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get),
                  [issue security
                  levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment
                  visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow
                  conditions.


                  #### Members and actors ####


                  In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an
                  *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a
                  project role.


                  Actors may be set as [default
                  members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role)
                  of the project role or set at the project level:

                   *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
                   *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

                  *Note that although a new project role is available to all
                  projects upon creation, any default actors that are associated
                  with the project role are not added to projects that existed
                  prior to the role being created.*<

                  The `columns` parameter accepts a navigable field value and is
                  expressed as HTML form data. To specify multiple columns, pass
                  multiple `columns` parameters. For example, in curl:


                  `curl -X PUT -d columns=summary -d columns=description
                  https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/settings/columns`


                  If no column details are sent, then all default columns are
                  removed.


                  A navigable field is one that can be used as a column on the

                  Loads a custom avatar for a project or issue type.


                  Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the
                  request. Also, include the following headers:

                   *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
                   *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

                  For example:  

                  `curl --request POST `


                  `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


                  `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


                  `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


                  `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


                  `--url
                  'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/type/{type}/owner/{entityId}'`


                  The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are
                  specified, the square originates at the top left of the image.
                  The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the
                  height or width of the image.


                  The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16,
                  24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


                  After creating the avatar use:

                   *  [Update issue type](#api-rest-api-3-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue type's displayed avatar.
                   *  [Set project avatar](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to set it as the project's displayed avatar.

                  Returns a list of users that can be assigned to an issue. Use
                  this operation to find the list of users who can be assigned
                  to:

                   *  a new issue, by providing the `projectKeyOrId`.
                   *  an updated issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
                   *  to an issue during a transition (workflow action), by providing the `issueKey` and the transition id in `actionDescriptorId`. You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [ Get issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get).

                  In all these cases, you can pass an account ID to determine if
                  a user can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in
                  the response if they can be assigned to the issue or issue
                  transition.


                  This operation takes the users in the range defined by
                  `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and
                  then returns only the users from that range that can be
                  assigned the issue. This means the operation usually returns
                  fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the

                  Creates a workflow. You can define transition rules using the
                  shapes detailed in the following sections. If no transitional
                  rules are specified the default system transition rules are

                  to create both team and company-managed scoped workflows.


                  #### Conditions ####


                  Conditions enable workflow rules that govern whether a
                  transition can execute.


                  ##### Always false condition #####


                  A condition that always fails.

                      {
                         "type": "AlwaysFalseCondition"
                       }

                  ##### Block transition until approval #####


                  A condition that blocks issue transition if there is a pending
                  approval.

                      {
                         "type": "BlockInProgressApprovalCondition"
                       }

                  ##### Compare number custom field condition #####


                  A condition that allows transition if a comparison between a
                  number custom field and a value is true.

                      {
                         "type": "CompareNumberCFCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "comparator": "=",
                           "fieldId": "customfield_10029",
                           "fieldValue": 2
                         }
                       }

                   *  `comparator` One of the supported comparator: `=`, `>`, and `<`.
                   *  `fieldId` The custom numeric field ID. Allowed field types:
                      
                       *  `com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:float`
                       *  `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:jsw-story-points`
                   *  `fieldValue` The value for comparison.

                  ##### Hide from user condition #####


                  A condition that hides a transition from users. The transition
                  can only be triggered from a workflow function or REST API
                  operation.

                      {
                         "type": "RemoteOnlyCondition"
                       }

                  ##### Only assignee condition #####


                  A condition that allows only the assignee to execute a
                  transition.

                      {
                         "type": "AllowOnlyAssignee"
                       }

                  ##### Only Bamboo notifications workflow condition
                  (deprecated) #####


                  A condition that makes the transition available only to Bamboo
                  build notifications.

                      {
                         "type": "OnlyBambooNotificationsCondition"
                       }

                  ##### Only reporter condition #####


                  A condition that allows only the reporter to execute a
                  transition.

                      {
                         "type": "AllowOnlyReporter"
                       }

                  ##### Permission condition #####


                  A condition that allows only users with a permission to
                  execute a transition.

                      {
                         "type": "PermissionCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                             "permissionKey": "BROWSE_PROJECTS"
                         }
                       }

                   *  `permissionKey` The permission required to perform the transition. Allowed values: [built-in](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#built-in-permissions) or app defined permissions.

                  ##### Previous status condition #####


                  A condition that allows a transition based on whether an issue
                  has or has not transitioned through a status.

                      {
                         "type": "PreviousStatusCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "ignoreLoopTransitions": true,
                           "includeCurrentStatus": true,
                           "mostRecentStatusOnly": true,
                           "reverseCondition": true,
                           "previousStatus": {
                             "id": "5"
                           }
                         }
                       }

                  By default this condition allows the transition if the status,
                  as defined by its ID in the `previousStatus` object, matches
                  any previous issue status, unless:

                   *  `ignoreLoopTransitions` is `true`, then loop transitions (from and to the same status) are ignored.
                   *  `includeCurrentStatus` is `true`, then the current issue status is also checked.
                   *  `mostRecentStatusOnly` is `true`, then only the issue's preceding status (the one immediately before the current status) is checked.
                   *  `reverseCondition` is `true`, then the status must not be present.

                  ##### Separation of duties condition #####


                  A condition that prevents a user to perform the transition, if
                  the user has already performed a transition on the issue.

                      {
                         "type": "SeparationOfDutiesCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "fromStatus": {
                             "id": "5"
                           },
                           "toStatus": {
                             "id": "6"
                           }
                         }
                       }

                   *  `fromStatus` OPTIONAL. An object containing the ID of the source status of the transition that is blocked. If omitted any transition to `toStatus` is blocked.
                   *  `toStatus` An object containing the ID of the target status of the transition that is blocked.

                  ##### Subtask blocking condition #####


                  A condition that blocks transition on a parent issue if any of
                  its subtasks are in any of one or more statuses.

                      {
                         "type": "SubTaskBlockingCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "statuses": [
                             {
                               "id": "1"
                             },
                             {
                               "id": "3"
                             }
                           ]
                         }
                       }

                   *  `statuses` A list of objects containing status IDs.

                  ##### User is in any group condition #####


                  A condition that allows users belonging to any group from a
                  list of groups to execute a transition.

                      {
                         "type": "UserInAnyGroupCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "groups": [
                             "administrators",

                           ]
                         }
                       }

                   *  `groups` A list of group names.

                  ##### User is in any project role condition #####


                  A condition that allows only users with at least one project
                  roles from a list of project roles to execute a transition.

                      {

                  #### Validators ####


                  A validator rule that checks if a user has the required
                  permissions to execute the transition in the workflow.


                  ##### Permission validator #####


                  A validator rule that checks if a user has the required
                  permissions to execute the transition in the workflow.

                      {
                         "ruleKey": "system:check-permission-validator",

                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `permissionKey` The permission required to perform the transition. Allowed values: [built-in Jira permissions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#built-in-permissions).

                  ##### Parent or child blocking validator #####


                  A validator to block the child issue\\u2019s transition
                  depending on the parent issue\\u2019s status.

                      {
                         "ruleKey" : "system:parent-or-child-blocking-validator"
                         "parameters" : {
                           "blocker" : "PARENT"
                           "statusIds" : "1,2,3"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `blocker` currently only supports `PARENT`.
                   *  `statusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs.

                  ##### Previous status validator #####


                  A validator that checks if an issue has transitioned through
                  specified previous status(es) before allowing the current
                  transition to occur.

                      {
                         "ruleKey": "system:previous-status-validator",
                         "parameters": {

                           "mostRecentStatusOnly": "true"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `previousStatusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs, currently only support one ID.
                   *  `mostRecentStatusOnly` when `true` only considers the most recent status for the condition evaluation. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.

                  ##### Validate a field value #####


                  A validation that ensures a specific field's value meets the
                  defined criteria before allowing an issue to transition in the
                  workflow.


                  Depending on the rule type, the result will vary:

                  Parameters:

                   *  `fieldsRequired` the ID of the field that is required. For a custom field, it would look like `customfield_123`.
                   *  `ignoreContext` controls the impact of context settings on field validation. When set to `true`, the validator doesn't check a required field if its context isn't configured for the current issue. When set to `false`, the validator requires a field even if its context is invalid. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
                   *  `errorMessage` is the error message to display if the user does not provide a value during the transition. A default error message will be shown if you don't provide one (Optional).

                  #### Conditions ####


                  Conditions enable workflow rules that govern whether a
                  transition can execute.


                  ##### Check field value #####


                  A condition rule evaluates as true if a specific field's value
                  meets the defined criteria. This rule ensures that an issue
                  can only transition to the next step in the workflow if the
                  field's value matches the desired condition.

                      {
                         "ruleKey": "system:check-field-value",
                         "parameters": {
                           "fieldId": "description",
                           "fieldValue": "[\"Done\"]",
                           "comparator": "=",
                           "comparisonType": "STRING"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `fieldId` The ID of the field to check the value of. For non-system fields, it will look like `customfield_123`. Note: `fieldId` is used interchangeably with the idea of `fieldKey` here, they refer to the same field.
                   *  `fieldValue` the list of values to check against the field\\u2019s value.
                   *  `comparator` The comparison logic. Allowed values: `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<=`, `<`, `!=`.
                   *  `comparisonType` The type of data being compared. Allowed values: `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `DATE`, `DATE_WITHOUT_TIME`, `OPTIONID`.

                  ##### Restrict issue transition #####


                  This rule ensures that issue transitions are restricted based
                  on user accounts, roles, group memberships, and permissions,
                  maintaining control over who can transition an issue. This
                  condition evaluates as `true` if any of the following criteria
                  is met.

                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `accountIds` a comma-separated list of the user account IDs. It also allows generic values like: `allow-assignee`, `allow-reporter`, and `accountIds` Note: This is only supported in team-managed projects

                ### About notification schemes ###


                A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who
                will receive notifications for those events. The list is
                contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and
                contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

                 *  `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-notification-schemes/) (see the *Events* section) or [custom events](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/add-a-custom-event/).
                 *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
                    
                     *  `CurrentAssignee`
                     *  `Reporter`
                     *  `CurrentUser`
                     *  `ProjectLead`

                     *  `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
                     *  `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
                     *  `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
                     *  `EmailAddress` *(deprecated)*
                     *  `AllWatchers`
                     *  `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

                Issue security schemes control which users or groups of users
                can view an issue. When an issue security scheme is associated
                with a project, its security levels can be applied to issues in
                that project. Sub-tasks also inherit the security level of their
                parent issue.

                ### About issue security schemes ###


                Issue security schemes control which users or groups of users
                can view an issue. An issue security scheme is made up of
                multiple security levels. Each level can have users or groups of
                users assigned to it. The following are valid security level
                members:

                 *  Individual users
                 *  Groups of users
                 *  Project roles
                 *  Issue roles
                 *  "Anyone", for example to allow anonymous access
                 *  A (multi-)user or (multi-)group picker custom field

                This resource represents workflow schemes. Use it to manage
                workflow schemes and the workflow scheme's workflows and issue
                types.


                A workflow scheme maps issue types to workflows. A workflow
                scheme can be associated with one or more projects, which
                enables the projects to use the workflow-issue type mappings.


                Active workflow schemes (workflow schemes that are used by
                projects) cannot be edited. When an active workflow scheme is
                edited, a draft copy of the scheme is created. The draft
                workflow scheme is then be edited and published (replacing the
                active scheme).

                schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/tohKLg) for more

                body: >
                  This documentation is for **version 3** of the Jira Cloud
                  platform REST API, which is the latest version

                  but is in **beta**. [Version
                  2](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/)
                  and 

                  version 3 of the API offer the same collection of operations.
                  However, version 3 provides support for 

                  the [Atlassian Document
                  Format](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/)

                  ### Forge apps


                  For Forge apps, [REST API
                  scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) 

                  are used when authenticating with Jira Cloud platform. See
                  [Add scopes to call an Atlassian REST
                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/add-scopes-to-call-an-atlassian-rest-api/)
                  for more details.


                  The URIs for Forge app REST API calls have this structure:


                  `/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


                  For example, `/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


                  ### Connect apps


                  For Connect apps, authentication (JWT-based) is built into the
                  Connect libraries. Authorization is implemented using either 

                  scopes (shown as _App scope required_ for operations on this
                  page) or user impersonation. See 

                  [Security for Connect
                  apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/) 

                  for details.


                  The URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:


                  `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


                  For example,
                  `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


                  ### Other integrations


                  For integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth
                  2.0 authorization code grants (3LO) for security 

                  (3LO scopes are shown as for operations _OAuth scopes
                  required_). See 

                  [OAuth 2.0 (3LO)
                  apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) 

                  for details.


                  The URIs for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app REST API calls have this
                  structure:


                  `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


                  For example,
                  `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/35273b54-3f06-40d2-880f-dd28cf8daafa/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


                  ### Ad-hoc API calls


                  For personal scripts, bots, and ad-hoc execution of the REST
                  APIs use basic authentication. See [Basic auth for REST
                  APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)
                  for details. 


                  The URIs for basic authentication REST API calls have this
                  structure:


                  `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


                  For example,
                  `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`

                body: >
                  ### Operation permissions


                  Most operations in this API require permissions. The calling
                  user must have the required permissions for an operation to 

                  use it. Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the
                  required permissions for the operation and the app must 

                  have scopes that permit the operation.


                  A permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue
                  role that the user is a member of, or granted directly to a
                  user. 

                  See [Permissions
                  overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) for
                  details. The most common permissions are:


                  - **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_
                  group have this 

                  permission. See [Manage
                  groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.

                  - **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_
                  global permission. There is a default group for this
                  permission. 

                  See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL)
                  and [Managing global
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for
                  details.

                  - **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer
                  projects_ project permission for a project. This can be 

                  granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

                  See [Managing project
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for
                  details.

                  - **Access a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Browse
                  projects_ project permission for a project. This can be 

                  granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

                  See [Managing project
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for
                  details.

                  - **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global
                  permission. Users in the default product access group (for
                  example, 

                  _jira-software-users-acmesite_) have this permission. 

                  See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL)
                  and

                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for
                  details.


                  ### Anonymous access


                  Some operations provide support for anonymous access. However,
                  anonymous access is only available if 

                  the Jira permission needed to access the object or records
                  returned by the operation is granted to 

                  the _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your
                  project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) 

                  for details.


                  If an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is
                  not available, the operation will return 

                  an error. Note that not all operations that correspond to
                  objects that can be given public access 

                  provide for anonymous access.

              - anchor: expansion
                body: >+
                  ### Expansion


                  The Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that
                  some parts of a resource are not returned unless specified 

                  in the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes
                  network traffic.


                  To expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand
                  query parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. 

                  If you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot
                  notation. If you need to expand multiple objects, use a 

                  comma-separated list. 


                  For example, the following request expands the `names` and
                  `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:


                  `GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`


                  To discover which object can be expanded, refer to the
                  `expand` property in the object. 

                  In the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as
                  expandable.


                  ```json

                  {
                    "expand": "widgets", 
                    "self": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1", 
                    "widgets": {
                      "widgets": [],
                      "size": 5
                     }
                  }

                  ```


                  ### Pagination


                  The Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance.
                  Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a
                  large 

                  collection of items. When you make a request to a paginated
                  resource, the response wraps the returned array of values in 

                  a JSON object with paging metadata. For example:


                  ```json

                  {
                      "startAt" : 0,
                      "maxResults" : 10,
                      "total": 200,
                      "isLast": false,
                      "values": [
                          { /* result 0 */ },
                          { /* result 1 */ },
                          { /* result 2 */ }
                      ]
                  }

                  ```


                  *   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the
                  page.

                  *   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page
                  can return. Each operation can have a different limit for
                      the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items 
                      that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.
                  *    `total` is the total number of items contained in all
                  pages. This number **_may change_** as the client 

                  requests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should
                  always assume that the requested page can be empty. Note 

                  that this property is not returned for all operations.

                  *   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last
                  one. Note that this property is not returned for all
                  operations.


                  ### Ordering


                  Some operations support ordering the elements of a response by
                  a field. Check the documentation for the operation to 

                  confirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which
                  fields can be used. Responses are listed in ascending order 

                  by default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query
                  parameter with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:


                  *   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.

                  *   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.

                  *   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.

                  system default user time zone.

                  The following request and response headers define important
                  metadata for the Jira Cloud REST API resources.


                  -   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept
                  multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token:
                  no-check`

                  header in requests. Otherwise the request is blocked by
                  cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.

                  -   `X-Force-Accept-Language` (request): controls how the
                  standard HTTP `Accept-Language` header is processed.

                  By default `Accept-Language` is ignored and the response is in
                  the language configured in the user's profile or,

                  when no language is configured for the user, the default Jira
                  instance language. For the response to recognize

                  `Accept-Language` send `X-Force-Accept-Language = true` as
                  well. If `Accept-Language` requests a language that Jira

                  can return the response is in that language, otherwise Jira
                  returns the response in the default language. If

                  `Accept-Language` is not specified the response is in the
                  default language.

                  -   `X-AAccountId` (response): This response header contains
                  the Atlassian account ID of the authenticated user.

                   Jira provides for all permissions, except the [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) Administer Jira, to be assigned to *Anyone*. Once a permission is assigned to *Anyone*, anyone knowing a project's URL is able to use the features in Jira enabled by the permission. However, the Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default. This means that an anonymous user who may be able to perform an action through Jira, may not be able to perform the same action where it's enabled by the REST API. 

                   The operations that provide anonymous access are annotated "This operation can be accessed anonymously."
                title: Anonymous operations

                body: >-
                  Some Jira REST API operations may trigger long-running or
                  computationally expensive tasks. In these cases, the
                  operation 

                  will schedule an asynchronous task and return a `303 (See
                  Other)` response, indicating the location of the queued task 

                  in the `Location` header. You can query this task to get
                  progress updates.


                  When the task finishes, the response object will contain the
                  `result` field. The content of the field is specific to the 

                  operation that created the task. Refer to the operation’s
                  documentation for more information.


                  Note that asynchronous tasks are not guaranteed to be run in
                  order. In other words, if you need your tasks to execute 

                  in a certain order, you should start a task only after the
                  prerequisite task(s) have finished.

                  The Jira Cloud platform REST API uses the [standard HTTP
                  status
                  codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


                  Operations that return an error status code may also return a
                  response body containing details of the error or errors. 

                  The schema for the response body is shown below:

                  CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/).


                  Example initial call:

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

                  ```


                  Example response:

                  ```

                  {
                    "results": [
                      { ... },
                      { ... },
                      ...
                      { ... }
                    ],
                    "limit": 25,
                    "size": 25,
                    ...
                    "_links": {
                      "base": "<url>",

                  }

                  ```


                  When additional results are available, returns `next` and
                  `prev` URLs to retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs
                  each contain a cursor that points to the appropriate set of
                  results. Use `limit` to specify the number of results returned
                  in each call.

                  Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

                  ```

                  The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the
                  `next` in the example response.

                  Returns a map of the direct children of a piece of content. A
                  piece of content

                  has different types of child content, depending on its type.
                  These are

                  the default parent-child content type relationships:


                  - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

                  - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


                  Apps can override these default relationships. Apps can also
                  introduce

                  new content types that create new parent-child content
                  relationships.


                  Note, the map will always include all child content types that
                  are valid

                  for the content. However, if the content has no instances of a
                  child content

                  type, the map will contain an empty array for that child
                  content type.

                  Caution: This API can move pages to the top level of a space.
                  Top-level pages are difficult to find in the UI

                  because they do not show up in the page tree display. To avoid
                  this, never use `before` or `after` positions

                  when the `targetId` is a top-level page.

                  version of the

                  attachment is created).


                  Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on
                  the request

                  for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects
                  against XSRF

                  attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts
                  multipart/form-data.


                  The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
                  7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

                  Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to
                  implement

                  multipart posts, like the
                  [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

                  Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


                  Note, according to [RFC
                  7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

                  in the case where the form data is text,

                  the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be
                  used to

                  indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
                  of this

                  API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
                  `type=text/plain`

                  and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be
                  UTF-8.


                  Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to
                  a piece of

                  content (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. If
                  the 'example.txt'

                  file already exists, it will update it with a new version of
                  the attachment.


                  ``` bash

                  curl -D- \
                    -u admin:admin \

                  Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on
                  the request

                  for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects
                  against XSRF

                  attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts
                  multipart/form-data.


                  The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
                  7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

                  Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to
                  implement

                  multipart posts, like the
                  [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

                  Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


                  Note, according to [RFC
                  7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

                  in the case where the form data is text,

                  the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be
                  used to

                  indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
                  of this

                  API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
                  `type=text/plain`

                  and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be
                  UTF-8.


                  Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to
                  a container

                  (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true.

                  Returns all children of a given type, for a piece of content.

                  A piece of content has different types of child content,
                  depending on its type:


                  - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

                  that this

                  direct

                  child pages.


                  A piece of content has different types of descendants,
                  depending on its type:


                  - `page`: descendant is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: descendant is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: descendant is `comment`

                  - `comment`: descendant is `attachment`


                  The map will always include all descendant types that are
                  valid for the content.

                  However, if the content has no instances of a descendant type,
                  the map will

                  contain an empty array for that descendant type.

                  (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:
                  '884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.

                  The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are
                  created, and is

                  only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


                  Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will
                  also match on

                  the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This
                  check will

                  eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for
                  pages and

                  transparently propagate out to all instances.

                  Copy page hierarchy allows the copying of an entire hierarchy
                  of pages and their associated properties, permissions and
                  attachments.
                   The id path parameter refers to the content id of the page to copy, and the new parent of this copied page is defined using the destinationPageId in the request body.
                   The titleOptions object defines the rules of renaming page titles during the copy;
                   for example, search and replace can be used in conjunction to rewrite the copied page titles.

                   Response example:
                   <pre><code>
                   {
                        "id" : "1180606",

                   is defined using the `destination` in the request body and can be one of the following types.

                    - `space`: page will be copied to the specified space as a root page on the space

                  use this method

                  to create any type of relationship between two entities.


                  For example, the following method creates a 'sibling'

                  for more details.


                  Example initial call:

                  /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

                  ```


                  Example response:

                  ```

                  {
                    "results": [
                      { ... },

                      ...
                      { ... }
                    ],
                    "limit": 25,
                    "size": 25,
                    ...
                    "_links": {
                      "base": "<url>",

                    }
                  }

                  ```


                  When additional results are available, returns `next` and
                  `prev` URLs to retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs
                  each contain a cursor that points to the appropriate set of
                  results. Use `limit` to specify the number of results returned
                  in each call.


                  Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

                  ```

                  The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the
                  `next` in the example response.

                  Notes:


                  - Labels can also be added when creating content ([Create
                  content](#api-content-post)).

                  - Labels can be updated when updating content ([Update

                  This will delete the existing labels and replace them with the
                  labels in

                  the request.

                body: >-
                  This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API. This
                  API is the primary way to get and

                  modify data in Confluence Cloud, whether you are developing an
                  app or any other integration.

                  Use it to interact with Confluence entities, like pages and
                  blog posts, spaces, users, groups,

                  and more.
              - title: Authentication and authorization
                anchor: auth
                body: >-
                  **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app,
                  authentication is implemented via JWT or OAuth 2.0, depending
                  on what you are building (see [Security
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)).
                  Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST
                  API, the REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for
                  REST
                  APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).


                  **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app,
                  authorization can be implemented by
                  [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/)
                  or by [OAuth 2.0 user
                  impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps).
                  Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST
                  API, authorization is based on the user used in the
                  authentication process.


                  See [Security
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)
                  for more details on authentication and authorization.
              - title: Status codes
                anchor: status-code
                body: >-
                  The Confluence REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
                  codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


                  Responses that return an error status code will also return a
                  response body, similar to the following:

                  ```json

                  {
                    "statusCode": 404,
                    "data": {
                      "authorized": false,
                      "valid": false,
                      "errors": [
                        {
                          "message": {
                            "translation": "This is an example error message.",
                            "args": []
                          }
                        }
                      ],
                      "successful": false
                    },
                    "message": "This is an example error message."
                  }

                  ```
              - title: Using the REST API
                anchor: using
                body: >-
                  **Expansion:** The Confluence REST API uses resource
                  expansion: some parts of a resource are not returned unless
                  explicitly specified. This simplifies responses and minimizes
                  network traffic.


                  To expand part of a resource in a request, use the `expand`
                  query parameter and specify the entities to be expanded. If
                  you need to expand nested entities, use the `.` dot notation.
                  For example, the following request will expand information
                  about the requested content's space and labels:

                  ```

                  GET /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=space,metadata.labels

                  ```

                  **Pagination:** The Confluence REST API uses pagination: a
                  method that returns a response with multiple objects can only
                  return a limited number at one time. This limits the size of
                  responses and conserves server resources.


                  Use the 'limit' and 'start' query parameters to specify
                  pagination:


                  - `limit` is the number of objects to return per page. This
                  may be restricted by system limits.

                  - `start` is the index of the first item returned in the page
                  of results. The base index is 0.


                  For example, the following request will return ten content
                  objects, starting from the fifth object.

                  ```

                  GET /wiki/rest/api/content?start=4&limit=10

                  ```

                  **Special headers:**


                  - `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` request header must be
                  specified for methods

                  that are protected from Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)
                  attacks. This is

                  stated in the method description, if required. For more
                  information, see this

                anchor: capabilities
                body: >-
                  **Webhooks:** A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP.
                  You can use Confluence webhooks to notify your app or web
                  application when certain events occur in Confluence. For
                  example, when a page is created or updated. To learn more, see
                  [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/webhook/).


                  **Content properties:** Content properties are a key-value
                  storage associated with a piece of Confluence content. If you
                  are building an app, this is one form of persistence that you
                  can use. You can use the Confluence REST API to get, update,
                  and delete content properties. To learn more, see [Content
                  properties in the REST
                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/content-properties/).


                  **CQL:** The Confluence Query Language (CQL) allows you to

                  Updates the application installation for the user.


                  This endpoint is intended to be used by Bitbucket Connect apps

                  and only supports JWT authentication -- that is how Bitbucket

                  identifies the particular installation of the app. Developers

                  with applications registered in the "Develop Apps" section

                  of Bitbucket need not use this endpoint as updates for those

                  applications can be sent out via the UI of that section.


                  Passing an empty body will update the installation using the

                  existing descriptor URL.


                  ```

                  $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
                    -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
                    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
                    --data '{}'
                  ```


                  The new `descriptor` for the installation can be also provided

                  in the body directly.


                  ```

                  $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
                    -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
                    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
                    --data '{"descriptor": $NEW_DESCRIPTOR}'
                  ```


                  In both these modes the URL of the descriptor cannot be
                  changed. To

                  change the descriptor location and upgrade an installation

                  the request must be made exclusively with a `descriptor_url`.

                   ```
                  $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
                    -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
                    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
                    --data '{"descriptor_url": $NEW_URL}'
                  ```


                  The `descriptor_url` must exactly match the marketplace
                  registration

                  that Atlassian has for the application. Contact your Atlassian

                  developer advocate to update this registration. Once the
                  registration

                  has been updated you may call this resource for each
                  installation.


                  Note that the scopes of the application cannot be increased

                  in the new descriptor nor reduced to none.

                  Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a

                  repository, the request body depends on the intent.


                  #### Creation


                  See the POST documentation for the repository endpoint for an
                  example

                  of the request body.


                  #### Update


                  Note: Changing the `name` of the repository will cause the
                  location to

                  be changed. This is because the URL of the repo is derived
                  from the

                  name (a process called slugification). In such a scenario, it
                  is

                  possible for the request to fail if the newly created slug
                  conflicts

                  with an existing repository's slug. But if there is no
                  conflict,

                  Creates a new branch restriction rule for a repository.


                  `kind` describes what will be restricted. Allowed values
                  include:

                  `push`, `force`, `delete`, `restrict_merges`,
                  `require_tasks_to_be_completed`,

                  `require_approvals_to_merge`,
                  `require_default_reviewer_approvals_to_merge`,

                  `require_no_changes_requested`,
                  `require_passing_builds_to_merge`, `require_commits_behind`,

                  `reset_pullrequest_approvals_on_change`,
                  `smart_reset_pullrequest_approvals`,

                  `reset_pullrequest_changes_requested_on_change`,
                  `require_all_dependencies_merged`,

                  `enforce_merge_checks`, and
                  `allow_auto_merge_when_builds_pass`.


                  Different kinds of branch restrictions have different
                  requirements:


                  * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to
                  be
                    specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is
                    denied for everybody.

                  The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are

                  two ways to match a branch. It is configured in
                  `branch_match_kind`:


                  1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in
                     `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every
                     other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match
                     `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all
                     branches.
                  2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the
                  repository's
                     branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch
                     to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`,
                     `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`.

                  The combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means
                  that

                  two `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same
                  `kind` and

                  `pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in
                  a

                  repository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`.


                  `users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are
                  except from

                  the restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and

                  `restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a
                  user

                  pushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or
                  is a

                  member of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a
                  user

                  merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is
                  in

                  `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new
                  users or

                  groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.


                  Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is
                  allowed,

                  but the resulting behavior may be surprising.

                  The `development` branch can be configured to a specific
                  branch or to

                  track the main branch. When set to a specific branch it must

                  currently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated.
                  The

                  properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request
                  without a

                  `development` property will leave the development branch
                  unchanged.


                  It is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid.
                  This

                  happens when it points at a specific branch that has been

                  deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the
                  branch. It is

                  not possible to update the settings for `development` if that

                  would leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request
                  will be

                  rejected.


                  The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main

                  branch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must
                  currently

                  exist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`)
                  or

                  disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be
                  updated. The

                  properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request
                  without a

                  `production` property will leave the production branch
                  unchanged.


                  It is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This

                  happens when it points at a specific branch that has been

                  deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the
                  branch. A

                  request that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will
                  be

                  rejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it
                  invalid if

                  it would also be left disabled.


                  The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be
                  updated.

                  Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will
                  be

                  rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid
                  state.

                  For branch types this means that:


                  1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For
                  example,
                     it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
                  2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of
                  another
                     enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
                     classified by its prefix unambiguously.

                  It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type
                  would be

                  left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The

                  properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type
                  must

                  have a `kind` property to identify it.


                  There is currently a side effect when using this API endpoint.
                  If the

                  repository is inheriting branching model settings from its
                  project,

                  updating the branching model for this repository will disable
                  the

                  project setting inheritance.



                  We have deprecated this side effect and will remove it on 1

                  Bulk upload of annotations.

                  Annotations are individual findings that have been identified
                  as part of a report, for example, a line of code that
                  represents a vulnerability. These annotations can be attached
                  to a specific file and even a specific line in that file,
                  however, that is optional. Annotations are not mandatory and a
                  report can contain up to 1000 annotations.


                  Add the annotations you want to upload as objects in a JSON
                  array and make sure each annotation has the external_id field
                  set to a unique value. If you want to use an existing id from
                  your own system, we recommend prefixing it with your system's
                  name to avoid collisions, for example, mySystem-annotation001.
                  The external id can later be used to identify the report as an
                  alternative to the generated
                  [UUID](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/uri-uuid#uuid).
                  You can upload up to 100 annotations per POST request.

                  Just as reports, annotation needs to be uploaded with a unique

                  If the specified key already exists, the existing status
                  object will

                  be overwritten.


                  Example:


                  ```

                  curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repo/commit/e10dae226959c2194f2b07b077c07762d93821cf/statuses/build/

                    }'
                  ```


                  When creating a new commit status, you can use a URI template
                  for the URL.

                  Templates are URLs that contain variable names that Bitbucket
                  will

                  evaluate at runtime whenever the URL is displayed anywhere
                  similar to

                  parameter substitution in

                  [Bitbucket
                  Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/concepts/context-parameters.html).

                  For example, one could use
                  `https://foo.com/builds/{repository.full_name}`

                  which Bitbucket will turn into
                  `https://foo.com/builds/foo/bar` at render time.

                  The context variables available are `repository` and `commit`.

                  Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.


                  #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/


                  Returns all commits in the repo in topological order (newest
                  commit

                  first). All branches and tags are included (similar to

                  `git log --all`).


                  #### GET
                  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?exclude=master


                  Returns all commits in the repo that are not on master

                  (similar to `git log --all ^master`).


                  #### GET
                  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?include=foo&include=bar&exclude=fu&exclude=fubar


                  Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not
                  on `fu` or

                  `fubar` (similar to `git log foo bar ^fu ^fubar`).


                  An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit
                  the

                  results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be
                  a file

                  or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are
                  returned that

                  have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`.
                  It is

                  important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified,
                  the commits

                  returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent
                  commits that

                  do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.

                  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master


                  Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not
                  on `master`

                  that changed the file README.md.


                  #### GET
                  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=src/&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master


                  Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not
                  on `master`

                  that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its
                  children.


                  Because the response could include a very large number of
                  commits, it

                  is paginated. Follow the 'next' link in the response to
                  navigate to the

                  next page of commits. As with other paginated resources, do
                  not

                  construct your own links.


                  When the include and exclude parameters are more than can fit
                  in a

                  query string, clients can use a `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST
                  instead.

                  Produces a raw git-style diff.


                  #### Single commit spec


                  If the `spec` argument to this API is a single commit, the
                  diff is

                  produced against the first parent of the specified commit.


                  #### Two commit spec


                  Two commits separated by `..` may be provided as the `spec`,
                  e.g.,

                  `3a8b42..9ff173`. When two commits are provided and the
                  `topic` query

                  parameter is true, this API produces a 2-way three dot diff.

                  This is the diff between source commit and the merge base of
                  the source

                  commit and the destination commit. When the `topic` query
                  param is false,

                  a simple git-style diff is produced.


                  The two commits are interpreted as follows:


                  * First commit: the commit containing the changes we wish to
                  preview

                  * Second commit: the commit representing the state to which we
                  want to
                    compare the first commit
                  * **Note**: This is the opposite of the order used in `git
                  diff`.


                  #### Comparison to patches


                  While similar to patches, diffs:


                  * Don't have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)

                  * Support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter
                    the diff to just that one file diff

                  #### Response


                  The raw diff is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files
                  in the

                  repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the

                  content-type is `text/plain`.

                  Returns a paginated list of commits that modified the
                  specified file.


                  Commits are returned in reverse chronological order. This is
                  roughly

                  equivalent to the following commands:

                      $ git log --follow --date-order <sha> <path>

                  By default, Bitbucket will follow renames and the path name in
                  the

                  returned entries reflects that. This can be turned off using
                  the

                  `?renames=false` query parameter.


                  Results are returned in descending chronological order by
                  default, and

                  like most endpoints you can

                  [filter and sort](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) the
                  response to

                  only provide exactly the data you want.


                  The example response returns commits made before 2011-05-18
                  against a file

                  named `README.rst`. The results are filtered to only return
                  the path and

                  date. This request can be made using:


                  ```

                  $ curl
                  'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/dogslow/filehistory/master/README.rst'\
                    '?fields=values.next,values.path,values.commit.date&q=commit.date<=2011-05-18'
                  ```


                  In the response you can see that the file was renamed to
                  `README.rst`

                  by the commit made on 2011-05-16, and was previously named
                  `README.txt`.

                  Creates a new fork of the specified repository.


                  #### Forking a repository


                  To create a fork, specify the workspace explicitly as part of
                  the

                  request body:


                  ```

                  $ curl -X POST -u jdoe
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/forks
                  \
                    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
                      "name": "bbql_fork",
                      "workspace": {
                        "slug": "atlassian"
                      }
                  }'

                  ```


                  To fork a repository into the same workspace, also specify a
                  new `name`.


                  When you specify a value for `name`, it will also affect the
                  `slug`.

                  The `slug` is reflected in the repository URL of the new fork.
                  It is

                  derived from `name` by substituting non-ASCII characters,
                  removes

                  whitespace, and changes characters to lower case. For example,

                  `My repo` would turn into `my_repo`.


                  You need contributor access to create new forks within a
                  workspace.



                  #### Change the properties of a new fork


                  By default the fork inherits most of its properties from the
                  parent.

                  However, since the optional POST body document follows the
                  normal

                  `repository` JSON schema and you can override the new fork's

                  properties.


                  Properties that can be overridden include:


                  * description

                  * fork_policy

                  * language

                  * mainbranch

                  * is_private (note that a private repo's fork_policy might
                  prohibit
                    the creation of public forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)
                  * has_issues (to initialize or disable the new repo's issue
                  tracker --
                    note that the actual contents of the parent repository's issue
                    tracker are not copied during forking)
                  * has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --
                    note that the actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not
                    copied during forking)
                  * project (when forking into a private project, the fork's
                  `is_private`
                    must be `true`)

                  Properties that cannot be modified include:


                  * scm

                  * parent

                  * full_name

                  Creates a new webhook on the specified repository.


                  Example:


                  ```

                  $ curl -X POST -u credentials -H 'Content-Type:
                  application/json'
                    https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repo-slug/hooks
                    -d '
                      {
                        "description": "Webhook Description",
                        "url": "https://example.com/",
                        "active": true,
                        "secret": "this is a really bad secret",
                        "events": [
                          "repo:push",
                          "issue:created",
                          "issue:updated"
                        ]
                      }'
                  ```


                  When the `secret` is provided it will be used as the key to
                  generate a HMAC

                  digest value sent in the `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery
                  time. Passing

                  a `null` or empty `secret` or not passing a `secret` will
                  leave the webhook's

                  secret unset. Bitbucket only generates the `X-Hub-Signature`
                  when the webhook's

                  secret is set.


                  Note that this call requires the webhook scope, as well as any
                  scope

                  that applies to the events that the webhook subscribes to. In
                  the

                  example above that means: `webhook`, `repository` and `issue`.


                  Also note that the `url` must properly resolve and cannot be
                  an

                  internal, non-routed address.

                  * `description`

                  * `events`


                  The hook's secret is used as a key to generate the HMAC hex
                  digest sent in the

                  `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery time. This signature is
                  only generated

                  when the hook has a secret.


                  Set the hook's secret by passing the new value in the `secret`
                  field. Passing a

                  `null` value in the `secret` field will remove the secret from
                  the hook. The

                  hook's secret can be left unchanged by not passing the
                  `secret` field in the

                  request.

                  `account_id` of the user. This is to protect the integrity of
                  the audit

                  log even after a user account gets deleted.


                  The `changes.assignee` field is deprecated will disappear in
                  the

                  future. Use `changes.assignee_account_id` instead.

                  Makes a change to the specified issue.


                  For example, to change an issue's state and assignee, create a
                  new

                  change object that modifies these fields:


                  ```

                  curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/site/master/issues/1234/changes
                  \
                    -s -u evzijst -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                    -d '{
                      "changes": {
                        "assignee_account_id": {
                          "new": "557058:c0b72ad0-1cb5-4018-9cdc-0cde8492c443"
                        },
                        "state": {
                          "new": 'resolved"
                        }
                      }
                      "message": {
                        "raw": "This is now resolved."
                      }
                    }'
                  ```


                  The above example also includes a custom comment to go
                  alongside the

                  change. This comment will also be visible on the issue page in
                  the UI.


                  The fields of the `changes` object are strings, not objects.
                  This

                  allows for immutable change log records, even after user
                  accounts,

                  milestones, or other objects recorded in a change entry, get
                  renamed or

                  deleted.


                  The `assignee_account_id` field stores the account id. When
                  POSTing a

                  new change and changing the assignee, the client should
                  therefore use

                  the user's account_id in the `changes.assignee_account_id.new`
                  field.


                  This call requires authentication. Private repositories or
                  private

                  issue trackers require the caller to authenticate with an
                  account that

                  has appropriate authorization.

                description: >
                  Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline.

                  There are a couple of different options to initiate a
                  pipeline, where the payload of the request will determine
                  which type of pipeline will be instantiated.

                  # Trigger a Pipeline for a branch

                  One way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the branch for
                  which you want to trigger a pipeline.

                  The specified branch will be used to determine which pipeline
                  definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be
                  applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will then do a
                  clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of
                  the specified branch.


                  ### Example


                  ```

                  $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
                    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                   https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
                    -d '
                    {
                      "target": {
                        "ref_type": "branch",
                        "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
                        "ref_name": "master"
                      }
                    }'
                  ```

                  # Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag

                  You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the
                  context of a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or
                  bookmark).

                  The specified reference will be used to determine which
                  pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will
                  be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone
                  the repository and then do a checkout the specified reference.


                  The following reference types are supported:


                  * `branch`

                  * `named_branch`

                  * `bookmark`
                   * `tag`

                  ### Example


                  ```

                  $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
                    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                    https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
                    -d '
                    {
                      "target": {
                        "commit": {
                          "type": "commit",
                          "hash": "ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956"
                        },
                        "ref_type": "branch",
                        "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
                        "ref_name": "master"
                      }
                    }'
                  ```

                  # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit

                  You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your
                  `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit.

                  In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and
                  pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline
                  definition. The resulting pipeline will then clone the
                  repository and checkout the specified revision.


                  ### Example

                           "type":"commit"

                          "type":"pipeline_commit_target"
                     }
                    }'
                  ```

                  # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit on a
                  branch or tag

                  You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your
                  `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit in the
                  context of a specified reference.

                  In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and
                  pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline
                  definition, as well as the reference information. The
                  resulting pipeline will then clone the repository a checkout
                  the specified reference.


                  ### Example

                  # Trigger a custom pipeline with variables

                  In addition to triggering a custom pipeline that is defined in
                  your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file as shown in the examples
                  above, you can specify variables that will be available for
                  your build. In the request, provide a list of variables,
                  specifying the following for each variable: key, value, and
                  whether it should be secured or not (this field is optional
                  and defaults to not secured).

                  using the `state` query parameter. To retrieve pull requests
                  that are

                  this repository and the author is the authenticated user.


                  The minimum required fields to create a pull request are
                  `title` and

                  `source`, specified by a branch name.


                  ```

                  curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repository/pullrequests

                      --data '{

                      }'
                  ```


                  If the pull request's `destination` is not specified, it will
                  default

                  to the `repository.mainbranch`. To open a pull request to a

                  different branch, say from a feature branch to a staging
                  branch,

                  specify a `destination` (same format as the `source`):


                  ```

                  {
                      "title": "My Title",

                          }
                      },
                      "destination": {
                          "branch": {
                              "name": "staging"
                          }
                      }
                  }

                  ```


                  Reviewers can be specified by adding an array of user objects
                  as the

                  `reviewers` property.


                  ```

                  This handler serves both a v20 and internal endpoint. The v20
                  endpoint

                  returns reviewer comments, updates, approvals and request
                  changes. The internal

                  endpoint includes those plus tasks and attachments.


                  Comments created on a file or a line of code have an inline
                  property.

                  This handler serves both a v20 and internal endpoint. The v20
                  endpoint

                  returns reviewer comments, updates, approvals and request
                  changes. The internal

                  endpoint includes those plus tasks and attachments.


                  Comments created on a file or a line of code have an inline
                  property.

                  When merging a pull request takes too long, the client
                  receives a

                  task ID along with a 202 status code. The task ID can be used
                  in a call

                  to this endpoint to check the status of a merge task.

                  If the merge task is not yet finished, a PENDING status will
                  be returned.

                  If the merge was successful, a SUCCESS status will be

                  the

                  root directory on the main branch.


                  This is equivalent to directly hitting

                  [/2.0/repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/src/{commit}/{path}](src/%7Bcommit%7D/%7Bpath%7D)

                  without having to know the name or SHA1 of the repo's main
                  branch.

                  This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository
                  by

                  uploading files.


                  To add a new file to a repository:


                  ```

                  $ curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
                    -F /repo/path/to/image.png=@image.png
                  ```


                  This will create a new commit on top of the main branch,
                  inheriting the

                  contents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the

                  `image.png` file to the repository in the `/repo/path/to`
                  directory.


                  To create a commit that deletes files, use the `files`
                  parameter:


                  ```

                  $ curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
                    -F files=/file/to/delete/1.txt \
                    -F files=/file/to/delete/2.txt
                  ```


                  You can add/modify/delete multiple files in a request.
                  Rename/move a

                  file by deleting the old path and adding the content at the
                  new path.


                  This endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` (as in the
                  examples above),

                  as well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.


                  Note: `multipart/form-data` is currently not supported by
                  Forge apps

                  for this API.


                  #### multipart/form-data


                  A `multipart/form-data` post contains a series of "form
                  fields" that

                  identify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as
                  well as

                  additional, optional meta data.


                  Files are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a

                  `Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to
                  the remote

                  path in the repository where the file should be stored. Path
                  field

                  names are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of
                  the

                  repository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash
                  (as the

                  above `curl` example did).


                  File contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as
                  text.


                  The commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for
                  the

                  request, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta
                  data fields

                  share the same namespace as the file objects. For
                  `multipart/form-data`

                  bodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the

                  `Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename`
                  parameter to

                  distinguish between a file named "message" and the commit
                  message field.


                  #### application/x-www-form-urlencoded


                  It is also possible to upload new files using a simple

                  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be
                  convenient when

                  uploading pure text files:


                  ```

                  $ curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src
                  \
                    --data-urlencode "/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum." \
                    --data-urlencode "message=Initial commit" \
                    --data-urlencode "author=Erik van Zijst <erik.van.zijst@gmail.com>"
                  ```


                  There could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a
                  file

                  named "message", as this filename clashes with the meta data
                  property

                  for the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files
                  whose names

                  clash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for
                  the files,

                  e.g. `curl --data-urlencode "/message=file contents"`.


                  When an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path
                  matches that of

                  a meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data,
                  not as a

                  file.


                  #### Executables and links


                  While this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases,
                  it is

                  possible to perform some more advanced operations like
                  creating a new

                  symlink in the repository, or creating an executable file.


                  Files can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the

                  `Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an
                  executable

                  file, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to
                  `README`:


                  ```

                  --===============1438169132528273974==

                  Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

                  MIME-Version: 1.0

                  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

                  Content-ID: "bin/shutdown.sh"

                  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="shutdown.sh";
                  x-attributes:"executable"


                  #!/bin/sh

                  halt


                  --===============1438169132528273974==

                  Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

                  MIME-Version: 1.0

                  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

                  Content-ID: "/README.txt"

                  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="README.txt";
                  x-attributes:"link"


                  README

                  --===============1438169132528273974==--

                  ```


                  Links are files that contain the target path and have

                  `x-attributes:"link"` set.


                  When overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly
                  uploaded

                  file determines both the new contents, as well as the
                  attributes. That

                  means uploading a file without specifying
                  `x-attributes="link"` will

                  create a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a
                  symlink at

                  the same path.


                  The same applies to executables. When modifying an existing
                  executable

                  file, the form-data file element must include

                  `x-attributes="executable"` in order to preserve the
                  executable status

                  of the file.


                  Note that this API does not support the creation or
                  manipulation of

                  subrepos / submodules.

                  This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single
                  file,

                  or the contents of a directory at a specified revision.


                  #### Raw file contents


                  When `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw
                  contents.

                  The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename

                  extension (not from the contents). The file contents are not
                  processed

                  and no character encoding/recoding is performed and as a
                  result no

                  character encoding is included as part of the Content-Type.


                  The `Content-Disposition` header will be "attachment" to
                  prevent

                  browsers from running executable files.


                  If the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to

                  Atlassian's media services platform is returned.


                  The response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of
                  the file

                  and its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py`
                  always

                  returns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives
                  in, or the

                  commit it is on.


                  #### File meta data


                  When the request for a file path includes the query parameter

                  `?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents,
                  Bitbucket

                  instead returns the JSON object describing the file's
                  properties:

                      }
                    },
                    "attributes": [],
                    "type": "commit_file",
                    "size": 0
                  }

                  ```


                  File objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a
                  list of

                  possible modifiers. Currently defined values are:


                  * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The
                  contents
                      of the file represent the path the link points to.
                  * `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable
                  bit set.

                  * `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a
                  submodule or
                      subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository
                      pointed to.
                  * `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is
                  binary.


                  This endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request
                  can be

                  used to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size
                  without

                  incurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.



                  #### Directory listings


                  When `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the
                  response is a

                  paginated list of directory and file objects in the same order
                  as the

                  underlying SCM system would return them.


                  For example:


                  ```javascript

                  $ curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests

                            }

                      }
                    ],
                    "page": 1,
                    "size": 2
                  }

                  ```


                  When listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the
                  use of a

                  trailing slash at the end of the URL is required.


                  The response by default is not recursive, meaning that only
                  the direct contents of

                  a path are returned. The response does not recurse down into

                  subdirectories. In order to "walk" the entire directory tree,
                  the

                  client can either parse each response and follow the `self`
                  links of each

                  `commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to
                  recurse to.


                  The max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to
                  return the contents of the subdirectories

                  up to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as
                  it leads to the least amount of

                  file system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter
                  is specified to be too

                  large, the call will time out and return a 555.


                  Each returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a
                  `commit_directory`,

                  both of which contain a `path` element. This path is the
                  absolute path

                  from the root of the repository. Each object also contains a
                  `commit`

                  object which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this
                  is merely

                  the commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit
                  that last

                  modified the file.


                  Directory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link
                  returns the

                  paginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the
                  other hand

                  returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:


                  ```javascript

                  {
                    "path": "tests/test_project",
                    "type": "commit_directory",
                    "links": {
                      "self": {
                        "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"
                      },
                      "meta": {
                        "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta"
                      }
                    },
                    "commit": { ... }
                  }

                  ```


                  #### Querying, filtering and sorting


                  Like most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket

                  querying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory
                  listing

                  to only include entries that match certain criteria. For
                  instance, to

                  list all binary files over 1kb use the expression:


                  `size > 1024 and attributes = "binary"`


                  which after urlencoding yields the query string:


                  `?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`


                  To change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort`
                  parameter:


                  `.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`


                  See [filtering and
                  sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) for more

                  details.

                  Returns all snippets. Like pull requests, repositories and
                  workspaces, the

                  full set of snippets is defined by what the current user has
                  access to.


                  This includes all snippets owned by any of the workspaces the
                  user is a member of,

                  or snippets by other users that the current user is either
                  watching or has collaborated

                  on (for instance by commenting on it).


                  To limit the set of returned snippets, apply the

                  `?role=[owner|contributor|member]` query parameter where the
                  roles are

                  defined as follows:


                  * `owner`: all snippets owned by the current user

                  * `contributor`: all snippets owned by, or watched by the
                  current user

                  * `member`: created in a workspaces or watched by the current
                  user


                  When no role is specified, all public snippets are returned,
                  as well as all

                  privately owned snippets watched or commented on.


                  The returned response is a normal paginated JSON list. This
                  endpoint

                  only supports `application/json` responses and no

                  `multipart/form-data` or `multipart/related`. As a result, it
                  is not

                  possible to include the file contents.

                  Creates a new snippet under the authenticated user's account.


                  Snippets can contain multiple files. Both text and binary
                  files are

                  supported.


                  The simplest way to create a new snippet from a local file:

                      $ curl -u username:password -X POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F file=@image.png

                  Creating snippets through curl has a few limitations and so
                  let's look

                  at a more complicated scenario.


                  Snippets are created with a multipart POST. Both
                  `multipart/form-data`

                  and `multipart/related` are supported. Both allow the creation
                  of

                  snippets with both meta data (title, etc), as well as multiple
                  text

                  and binary files.


                  The main difference is that `multipart/related` can use rich
                  encoding

                  for the meta data (currently JSON).



                  multipart/related (RFC-2387)

                  ----------------------------


                  This is the most advanced and efficient way to create a paste.

                  The request contains multiple parts and is structured as
                  follows.


                  The first part is the JSON document that describes the
                  snippet's

                  properties or meta data. It either has to be the first part,
                  or the

                  request's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start`
                  parameter to

                  point to it.


                  The remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero
                  or more.

                  Each file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header
                  through

                  which the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The
                  value

                  should be the name of the file.


                  `Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's

                  optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file
                  name

                  that Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When
                  present,

                  `filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.


                  When the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining
                  parts are

                  not ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as
                  if its

                  name was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is

                  mandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming
                  files).



                  multipart/form-data

                  -------------------


                  The use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta
                  data can

                  also be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional

                  `multipart/form-data` request:

                      $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F title="My snippet"               -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png

                      POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1
                      Content-Length: 951
                      Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f

                      ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
                      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
                      Content-Type: text/plain

                      foo

                      ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
                      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="image.png"
                      Content-Type: application/octet-stream

                      ?PNG

                      IHDR?1??I.....
                      ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
                      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

                      My snippet
                      ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--

                  Here the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level
                  form

                  fields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To
                  attach

                  multiple files, simply repeat the field.


                  The advantage of `multipart/form-data` over
                  `multipart/related` is

                  that it can be easier to build clients.


                  Essentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files`
                  included.



                  Sharing and Visibility

                  ----------------------


                  Snippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket,
                  as well

                  as anonymous users), or private (visible only to members of
                  the workspace).

                  This is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element:


                  * **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users
                  can view
                    the snippet
                  * **is_private=true** -- only workspace members can view the
                  snippet


                  To create the snippet under a workspace, just append the
                  workspace ID

                  to the URL. See
                  [`/2.0/snippets/{workspace}`](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-snippets/#api-snippets-workspace-post).

                  Retrieves a single snippet.


                  Snippets support multiple content types:


                  * application/json

                  * multipart/related

                  * multipart/form-data



                  application/json

                  ----------------


                  The default content type of the response is
                  `application/json`.

                  Since JSON is always `utf-8`, it cannot reliably contain file
                  contents

                  for files that are not text. Therefore, JSON snippet documents
                  only

                  contain the filename and links to the file contents.


                  This means that in order to retrieve all parts of a snippet,
                  N+1

                  requests need to be made (where N is the number of files in
                  the

                  snippet).



                  multipart/related

                  -----------------


                  To retrieve an entire snippet in a single response, use the

                  `Accept: multipart/related` HTTP request header.

                      $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/related" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/1

                  Response:

                  multipart/form-data

                  -------------------


                  As with creating new snippets, `multipart/form-data` can be
                  used as an

                  alternative to `multipart/related`. However, the inherently
                  flat

                  structure of form-data means that only basic, root-level
                  properties

                  can be returned, while nested elements like `links` are
                  omitted:

                  Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and
                  to

                  change a snippet's title.


                  To update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or
                  only the

                  parts that need to be changed.


                  The contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing
                  from the

                  request remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently

                  manipulated with differential payloads.


                  To delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its
                  name in

                  the request, but omit its value (use `null`).


                  As in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported.
                  Instead, to

                  rename a file, delete it and add it again under another name.
                  This can

                  be done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is
                  left to

                  the SCM.


                  PUT supports three different content types for both request
                  and

                  response bodies:


                  * `application/json`

                  * `multipart/related`

                  * `multipart/form-data`


                  The content type used for the request body can be different
                  than that

                  used for the response. Content types are specified using
                  standard HTTP

                  headers.


                  Use the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the
                  desired

                  request and response format.



                  application/json

                  ----------------


                  As with creation and retrieval, the content type determines
                  what

                  properties can be manipulated. `application/json` does not
                  support

                  file contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta
                  data.


                  To update the title, without changing any of its files:

                      $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": "Updated title"}'


                  To delete the title:

                      $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": null}'

                  Not all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and
                  creator

                  for instance are immutable.



                  multipart/related

                  -----------------


                  `multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of a
                  snippet's

                  properties. The body is identical to a POST. properties
                  omitted from

                  the request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part
                  contains JSON,

                  the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is
                  identical

                  to `application/json` requests.


                  To update one of a snippet's file contents, while also
                  changing its

                  title:

                  Here only the parts that are changed are included in the body.
                  The

                  other files remain untouched.


                  Note the use of the `files` list in the JSON part. This list
                  contains

                  the files that are being manipulated. This list should have

                  corresponding multiparts in the request that contain the new
                  contents

                  of these files.


                  If a filename in the `files` list does not have a
                  corresponding part,

                  it will be deleted from the snippet, as shown below:

                  To simulate a rename, delete a file and add the same file
                  under

                  another name:

                  file

                  contents and meta data atomically.

                      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

                      My updated snippet
                      ------------------------------63a4b224c59f

                  To delete a file, omit its contents while including its name
                  in the

                  `files` field:

                      $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj -F files=image.png

                      PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
                      Content-Length: 149

                      ------------------------------ef8871065a86--

                  The explicit use of the `files` element in `multipart/related`
                  and

                  `multipart/form-data` is only required when deleting files.

                  The default mode of operation is for file parts to be
                  processed,

                  regardless of whether or not they are listed in `files`, as a

                  convenience to the client.

                  Note that searches can match in the file's text
                  (`content_matches`),

                  the path (`path_matches`), or both.


                  You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI.

                  E.g. to search for "foo" only within the repository "demo",

                  use the query parameter `search_query=foo+repo:demo`.


                  Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a

                  `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information
                  about

                  the repository of matched files, use the query parameter

                  `search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository`

                  (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`).


                  Try `fields=%2Bvalues.*.*.*.*` to get an idea what's possible.

                  the repository of matched files, use the query parameter

                  `search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository`

                  (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`).

                  Creates a new webhook on the specified workspace.


                  Workspace webhooks are fired for events from all repositories
                  contained

                  by that workspace.


                  Example:


                  ```

                  $ curl -X POST -u credentials -H 'Content-Type:
                  application/json'
                    https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/my-workspace/hooks
                    -d '
                      {
                        "description": "Webhook Description",
                        "url": "https://example.com/",
                        "active": true,
                        "secret": "this is a really bad secret",
                        "events": [
                          "repo:push",
                          "issue:created",
                          "issue:updated"
                        ]
                      }'
                  ```


                  When the `secret` is provided it will be used as the key to
                  generate a HMAC

                  digest value sent in the `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery
                  time. Passing

                  a `null` or empty `secret` or not passing a `secret` will
                  leave the webhook's

                  secret unset. Bitbucket only generates the `X-Hub-Signature`
                  when the webhook's

                  secret is set.


                  This call requires the webhook scope, as well as any scope

                  that applies to the events that the webhook subscribes to. In
                  the

                  example above that means: `webhook`, `repository` and `issue`.


                  The `url` must properly resolve and cannot be an internal,
                  non-routed address.


                  Only workspace owners can install webhooks on workspaces.

                  * `events`


                  The hook's secret is used as a key to generate the HMAC hex
                  digest sent in the

                  `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery time. This signature is
                  only generated

                  when the hook has a secret.


                  Set the hook's secret by passing the new value in the `secret`
                  field. Passing a

                  `null` value in the `secret` field will remove the secret from
                  the hook. The

                  hook's secret can be left unchanged by not passing the
                  `secret` field in the

                  request.

                  Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a

                  project, the request body depends on the intent.


                  #### Creation


                  See the POST documentation for the project collection for an

                  example of the request body.


                  Note: The `key` should not be specified in the body of request

                  (since it is already present in the URL). The `name` is
                  required,

                  everything else is optional.


                  #### Update


                  See the POST documentation for the project collection for an

                  example of the request body.


                  Note: The key is not required in the body (since it is already
                  in

                  the URL). The key may be specified in the body, if the intent
                  is

                  to change the key itself. In such a scenario, the location of
                  the

                  project is changed and is returned in the `Location` header of
                  the

                  response.

                  The `development` branch can be configured to a specific
                  branch or to

                  track the main branch. Any branch name can be supplied, but
                  will only

                  successfully be applied to a repository via inheritance if
                  that branch

                  exists for that repository. Only the passed properties will be
                  updated. The

                  properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request
                  without a

                  `development` property will leave the development branch
                  unchanged.


                  The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main

                  branch or disabled. Any branch name can be supplied, but will
                  only

                  successfully be applied to a repository via inheritance if
                  that branch

                  exists for that repository. The `enabled` property can be used
                  to enable (`true`)

                  or disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be
                  updated. The

                  properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request
                  without a

                  `production` property will leave the production branch
                  unchanged.


                  The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be
                  updated.

                  Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will
                  be

                  rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid
                  state.

                  For branch types this means that:


                  1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For
                  example,
                     it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
                  2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of
                  another
                     enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
                     classified by its prefix unambiguously.

                  It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type
                  would be

                  left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The

                  properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type
                  must

                  have a `kind` property to identify it.

                  Note that searches can match in the file's text
                  (`content_matches`),

                  the path (`path_matches`), or both.


                  You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI.

                  E.g. to search for "foo" only within the repository "demo",

                  use the query parameter `search_query=foo+repo:demo`.


                  Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a

                  `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information
                  about

                  the repository of matched files, use the query parameter

                  `search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository`

                  (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`).


                  Try `fields=%2Bvalues.*.*.*.*` to get an idea what's possible.

              description: |
                Repository owners and administrators can set branch management
                rules on a repository that control what can be pushed by whom.
                Through these rules, you can enforce a project or team
                workflow. For example, owners or administrators can:

                * Limit push powers
                * Prevent branch deletion
                * Prevent history re-writes (Git only)
            - name: Branching model
              description: >
                The branching model resource is used to modify the branching
                model

                for a repository.


                You can use the branching model to define a branch based
                workflow

                for your repositories. When you map your workflow to branch
                types,

                you can ensure that branches are named consistently by
                configuring

                which branch types to make available.

                and deleting

                them.


                You can access public issues without authentication, but you
                can't gain access

                to private repositories' issues. By authenticating, you will get

                issues you

            - name: Webhooks
              description: >
                Webhooks provide a way to configure Bitbucket Cloud to make
                requests to

                your server (or another external service) whenever certain
                events occur in

                Bitbucket Cloud.


                A webhook consists of:


                * A subject -- The resource that generates the events.
                Currently, this resource

                is the repository, user account, or team where you create the
                webhook.

                * One or more event -- The default event is a repository push,
                but you can

                select multiple events that can trigger the webhook.

                * A URL -- The endpoint where you want Bitbucket to send the
                event payloads

                when a matching event happens.


                There are two parts to getting a webhook to work: creating the
                webhook and

                triggering the webhook. After you create a webhook for an event,
                every time

                that event occurs, Bitbucket sends a payload request that
                describes the event

                to the specified URL. Thus, you can think of webhooks as a kind
                of

                notification system.


                Use webhooks to integrate applications with Bitbucket Cloud. The
                following

                use cases provides examples of when you would want to use
                webhooks:


                * Every time a user pushes commits in a repository, you may want
                to notify

                your CI server to start a build.

                * Every time a user pushes commits or creates a pull request,
                you may want to

                display a notification in your application.

                  ### Basic auth


                  Basic HTTP Authentication as per
                  [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (Digest not
                  supported).

                  Note that Basic Auth is available only with username and [app
                  password](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/)
                  as credentials.


                  ### Access Tokens


                  Access Tokens are passwords (or tokens) that provide access to
                  a _single_ repository, project or workspace.

                  These tokens can authenticate with Bitbucket APIs for
                  scripting, CI/CD tools, Bitbucket Cloud-connected apps,

                  and Bitbucket Cloud integrations.


                  Access Tokens are linked to a repository, project, or
                  workspace, not a user account.

                  The level of access provided by the token is set when a
                  repository, or workspace admin creates it,

                  by setting permission scopes.


                  There are three types of Access Token:


                  * **Repository Access Tokens** can connect to a single
                  repository, preventing them from accessing any other
                  repositories or workspaces.

                  * **Project Access Tokens** can connect to a single project,
                  providing access to any repositories within the project.

                  * **Workspace Access Tokens** can connect to a single
                  workspace and have access to any projects and repositories
                  within that workspace.


                  When using Bitbucket APIs with an Access Token, the token will
                  be treated as the "user" in the

                  Bitbucket UI and Bitbucket logs. This includes when using the
                  Access Token to leave a comment on a pull request,

                  push a commit, or merge a pull request. The Bitbucket UI and
                  API responses will show the

                  Repository/Project/Workspace Access Token as a user. The
                  username shown in the Bitbucket UI is the Access

                  Token _name_, and a custom icon is used to differentiate it
                  from a regular user in the UI.


                  #### Considerations for using Access Tokens


                  * After creation, an Access Token can't be viewed or modified.
                  The token's name, created date,

                  last accessed date, and scopes are visible on the repository,
                  project, or workspace **Access Tokens** page.

                  * Access Tokens can access a limited set of Bitbucket's
                  permission scopes.

                  * Provided you set the correct permission scopes, you can use
                  an Access Token to clone (`repository`)

                  and push (`repository:write`) code to the token's repository
                  or the repositories the token can access.

                  * You can't use an Access Token to log into the Bitbucket
                  website.

                  * Access Tokens don't require two-step verification.

                  * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for
                  each Access Token.

                  * You can't use an Access Token to manipulate or query
                  repository, project, or workspace permissions.

                  * Access Tokens are not listed in any repository or workspace
                  permission API response.

                  * Access Tokens are deactivated when deleting the resource
                  tied to it (a repository, project, or workspace).

                  Repository Access Tokens are also revoked when transferring
                  the repository to another workspace.

                  * Any content created by the Access Token will persist after
                  the Access Token has been revoked.

                  * Access Tokens can interact with branch restriction APIs, but
                  the token can't be configured as a user with merge access when
                  using branch restrictions.


                  There are some APIs which are inaccessible for Access Tokens,
                  these are:


                  * [Add a repository deploy
                  key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-post)

                  * [Update a repository deploy
                  key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-put)

                  * [Delete a repository deploy
                  key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-delete)

                  ### App passwords


                  App passwords allow users to make API calls to their Bitbucket
                  account through apps such as Sourcetree.


                  Some important points about app passwords:


                  * You cannot view an app password or adjust permissions after
                  you create the app password. Because app passwords are
                  encrypted on our database and cannot be viewed by anyone. They
                  are essentially designed to be disposable. If you need to
                  change the scopes or lost the password just create a new one.

                  * You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.

                  * You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.

                      App passwords are tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.

                  * You can use them for API call authentication, even if you
                  don't have two-step verification enabled.

                  * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for
                  each app password.


                  For details on creating, managing, and using App passwords,
                  visit

                  [App
                  passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/).


                  ### OAuth 2.0


                  Our OAuth 2 implementation is merged in with our existing
                  OAuth 1 in

                  such a way that existing OAuth 1 consumers automatically
                  become

                  valid OAuth 2 clients. The only thing you need to do is edit
                  your

                  existing consumer and configure a callback URL.


                  Once that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:

                      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize
                      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token

                  For obtaining access/bearer tokens, we support three of
                  RFC-6749's grant

                  flows, plus a custom Bitbucket flow for exchanging JWT tokens
                  for access tokens.

                  Note that Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (4.3) is
                  no longer supported.



                  #### 1. Authorization Code Grant (4.1)


                  The full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the end
                  user by

                  sending their browser to:

                      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code

                  The callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you
                  can swap

                  for an access token:

                      $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
                        https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
                        -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}


                  #### 2. Implicit Grant (4.2)


                  This flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate
                  without server-side backends.


                  Request the end user for authorization by directing the
                  browser to:

                      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token

                  That will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a
                  fragment

                  containing the access token

                  (`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's
                  js can

                  pull it out of the URL.



                  #### 3. Client Credentials Grant (4.4)


                  Somewhat like our existing "2-LO" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain an
                  access

                  token that represents not an end user, but the owner of the

                  client/consumer:

                      $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
                        https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
                        -d grant_type=client_credentials


                  #### 4. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)


                  If your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication, you
                  can swap a

                  JWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token
                  represents the

                  account for which the add-on is installed.


                  Make sure you send the JWT token in the Authorization request
                  header

                  using the "JWT" scheme (case sensitive). Note that this custom
                  scheme

                  makes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and so you cannot
                  use "curl

                  -u").

                      $ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: JWT {jwt_token}" \
                        https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
                        -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt


                  #### Making Requests


                  Once you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can use it
                  in a request in any of

                  the following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):


                  1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer
                  {access_token}`

                  2. Include it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST
                  body as `access_token={access_token}`

                  3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST:
                  `?access_token={access_token}`



                  #### Repository Cloning


                  Since add-ons will not be able to upload their own SSH keys to
                  clone

                  with, access tokens can be used as Basic HTTP Auth credentials
                  to

                  clone securely over HTTPS. This is much like GitHub, yet
                  slightly

                  different:

                      $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git

                  The literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username
                  is

                  required (note the difference with GitHub where the actual
                  token is in

                  the username field).



                  #### Refresh Tokens


                  Our access tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll
                  get 401

                  responses.


                  Most access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT
                  excluded). Therefore, you should include a

                  refresh token that can then be used to generate a new access
                  token,

                  without the need for end user participation:

                      $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
                        https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
                        -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}


                  ### Bitbucket OAuth 2.0 scopes


                  Bitbucket's API applies a number of privilege scopes to
                  endpoints. In order to access an endpoint, a request will need
                  to have the necessary scopes.


                  OAuth 2.0 Scopes are applicable for OAuth 2, Access Tokens,
                  and App passwords auth mechanisms as well as Bitbucket Connect
                  apps.


                  Scopes are declared in the descriptor as a list of strings,
                  with each string being the name of a unique scope.


                  A descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly
                  assumed to require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will
                  require end users authorizing/installing the add-on

                  to explicitly accept all scopes.


                  Our best practice suggests you add only the scopes your add-on
                  needs, but no more than it needs.


                  Invalid scope strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected
                  and the installation to fail.


                  The available scopes are:


                  - [project](#project)

                  - [project:write](#project-write)

                  - [project:admin](#project-admin)

                  - [runner](#runner)

                  - [runner:write](#runner-write)


                  #### project


                  Provides access to view the project or projects.

                  This scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope,
                  giving read access to all the repositories in a project or
                  projects.


                  #### project:write


                  This scope is deprecated, and has been made obsolete by
                  `project:admin`. Please see the deprecation notice
                  [here](/cloud/bitbucket/deprecation-notice-project-write-scope).


                  #### project:admin


                  Provides admin access to a project or projects. No distinction
                  is made between public and private projects. This scope
                  doesn't implicitly grant the [`project`](#project) scope or
                  the [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope on any
                  repositories under the project. It gives access to the admin
                  features of a project only, not direct access to its
                  repositories' contents.


                  * ability to create the project

                  * ability to update the project

                  * ability to delete the project


                  #### repository


                  Provides read access to a repository or repositories.

                  Note that this scope does not give access to a repository's
                  pull requests.


                  * access to the repo's source code

                  * clone over HTTPS

                  * access the file browsing API

                  * download zip archives of the repo's contents

                  * the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo
                  (created issues, comment, vote, etc)

                  * the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo
                  (create/edit pages)


                  #### repository:write


                  Provides write (not admin) access to a repository or
                  repositories. No distinction is made between public and
                  private repositories. This scope implicitly grants the
                  [`repository`](#repository) scope, which does not need to be
                  requested separately.

                  This scope alone does not give access to the pull requests
                  API.


                  * push access over HTTPS

                  * fork repos


                  #### repository:admin


                  Provides admin access to a repository or repositories. No
                  distinction is made between public and private repositories.
                  This scope doesn't implicitly grant the
                  [`repository`](#repository) or the
                  [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scopes. It gives
                  access to the admin features of a repo only, not direct access
                  to its contents. This scope can be used or misused to grant
                  read access to other users, who can then clone the repo, but
                  users that need to read and write source code would also
                  request explicit read or write.

                  This scope comes with access to the following functionality:


                  * View and manipulate committer mappings

                  * List and edit deploy keys

                  * Ability to delete the repo

                  * View and edit repo permissions

                  * View and edit branch permissions

                  * Import and export the issue tracker

                  * Enable and disable the issue tracker

                  * List and edit issue tracker version, milestones and
                  components

                  * Enable and disable the wiki

                  * List and edit default reviewers

                  * List and edit repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)

                  * List and edit the repository webhooks

                  * Initiate a repo ownership transfer


                  #### repository:delete


                  Provides access to delete a repository or repositories.


                  #### pullrequest


                  Provides read access to pull requests.

                  This scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope,
                  giving read access to the pull request's destination
                  repository.


                  * see and list pull requests

                  * create and resolve tasks

                  * comment on pull requests


                  #### pullrequest:write


                  Implicitly grants the [`pullrequest`](#pullrequest) scope and
                  adds the ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.

                  This scope also implicitly grants the
                  [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope, giving write
                  access to the pull request's destination repository. This is
                  necessary to allow merging.


                  * merge pull requests

                  * decline pull requests

                  * create pull requests

                  * approve pull requests


                  #### issue


                  Ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo
                  members can.

                  This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and
                  doesn't give implicit access to the repository.


                  * view, list and search issues

                  * create new issues

                  * comment on issues

                  * watch issues

                  * vote for issues


                  #### issue:write


                  This scope implicitly grants the [`issue`](#issue) scope and
                  adds the ability to transition and delete issues.

                  This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and
                  doesn't give implicit access to the repository.


                  * transition issues

                  * delete issues


                  #### wiki


                  Provides access to wikis. This scope provides both read and
                  write access (wikis are always editable by anyone with access
                  to them).

                  This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and
                  doesn't give implicit access to the repository.


                  * view wikis

                  * create pages

                  * edit pages

                  * push to wikis

                  * clone wikis


                  #### webhook


                  Gives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any
                  webhook-related operation.


                  This scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions
                  on all

                  resources the authorization mechanism can access, without
                  needing further scopes.

                  For example:


                  - A client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on a
                  repository. The [`repository`](#repository) scope is not
                  required.

                  - Existing webhook subscriptions for the issue tracker on a
                  repo can be retrieved without the [`issue`](#issue) scope. All
                  that is required is the `webhook` scope.


                  To create webhooks, the client will need read access to the
                  resource. Such as: for [`issue:created`](#issue-created), the
                  client will need to

                  have both the `webhook` and the [`issue`](#issue) scope.


                  * list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository,
                  user, team, or snippet

                  * create/update/delete webhook subscriptions.


                  #### snippet


                  Provides read access to snippets.

                  No distinction is made between public and private snippets
                  (public snippets are accessible without any form of
                  authentication).


                  * view any snippet

                  * create snippet comments


                  #### snippet:write


                  Provides write access to snippets.

                  No distinction is made between public and private snippets
                  (public snippets are accessible without any form of
                  authentication).

                  This scope implicitly grants the [`snippet`](#snippet) scope
                  which does not need to be requested separately.


                  * create snippets

                  * edit snippets

                  * delete snippets


                  #### email


                  Ability to see the user's primary email address. This should
                  make it easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider for
                  apps or external applications.


                  #### account


                  When used for:

                  * **user-related APIs** — Gives read-only access to the user's
                  account information.

                  Note that this doesn't include any ability to change any of
                  the data. This scope allows you to view the user's:
                    * email addresses
                    * language
                    * location
                    * website
                    * full name
                    * SSH keys
                    * user groups
                  * **workspace-related APIs** — Grants access to view the
                  workspace's:
                    * users
                    * user permissions
                    * projects

                  #### account:write


                  Ability to change properties on the user's account.


                  * delete the authorizing user's account

                  * manage the user's groups

                  * change a user's email addresses

                  * change username, display name and avatar


                  #### pipeline


                  Gives read-only access to pipelines, steps, deployment
                  environments and variables.


                  #### pipeline:write


                  Gives write access to pipelines. This scope allows a user to:

                  * Stop pipelines

                  * Rerun failed pipelines

                  * Resume halted pipelines

                  * Trigger manual pipelines.


                  This scope is not needed to trigger a build using a push.
                  Performing a `git push` (or equivalent actions) will trigger
                  the build. The token doing the push only needs the
                  [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope.


                  This doesn't give write access to create variables.


                  #### pipeline:variable


                  Gives write access to create variables in pipelines at the
                  various levels:

                  * Workspace

                  * Repository

                  * Deployment


                  #### runner


                  Gives read-only access to pipelines runners setup against a
                  workspace or repository.


                  #### runner:write


                  Gives write access to create/edit/disable/delete pipelines
                  runners setup against a workspace or repository.

                  ### Forge app scopes


                  In order for a Forge app integration to access Bitbucket API
                  endpoints, it needs to include certain privilege scopes in the
                  app manifest. These are different from Bitbucket OAuth 2.0
                  scopes.


                  Unlike OAuth 2.0 scopes, Forge app scopes do not implicitly
                  grant other scopes, for example, `write:repository:bitbucket`
                  does not implicitly grant `read:repository:bitbucket`.


                  Only a subset of Bitbucket API endpoints are currently
                  available for Forge app integrations. These will be labeled
                  with Forge app scopes.


                  Our best practice suggests you only add the scopes your app
                  needs, but no more than it needs.


                  The available scopes are:


                  - [`read:repository:bitbucket`](#read-repository-bitbucket)

                  - [`write:repository:bitbucket`](#write-repository-bitbucket)

                  - [`admin:repository:bitbucket`](#admin-repository-bitbucket)

                  -
                  [`delete:repository:bitbucket`](#delete-repository-bitbucket)

                  - [`read:pullrequest:bitbucket`](#read-pullrequest-bitbucket)

                  -
                  [`write:pullrequest:bitbucket`](#write-pullrequest-bitbucket)

                  - [`read:project:bitbucket`](#read-project-bitbucket)

                  - [`admin:project:bitbucket`](#admin-project-bitbucket)

                  - [`read:workspace:bitbucket`](#read-workspace-bitbucket)

                  - [`read:user:bitbucket`](#read-user-bitbucket)

                  - [`read:pipeline:bitbucket`](#read-pipeline-bitbucket)

                  - [`write:pipeline:bitbucket`](#write-pipeline-bitbucket)

                  - [`admin:pipeline:bitbucket`](#admin-pipeline-bitbucket)

                  - [`read:runner:bitbucket`](#read-runner-bitbucket)

                  - [`write:runner:bitbucket`](#write-runner-bitbucket)


                  #### read:repository:bitbucket


                  Allows viewing of repository data. Note that this scope does
                  not give access to a repository's pull requests.

                  * access to the repository's source code

                  * access the file browsing API

                  * access to certain repository configurations such as
                  branching model, default reviewers, etc.


                  #### write:repository:bitbucket


                  Allows modification of repository data. No distinction is made
                  between public and private repositories. This scope does not
                  imply the `read:repository:bitbucket` scope, so you need to
                  request that separately if required. This scope alone does not
                  give access to the pull request API.

                  * update/delete source, branches, tags, etc.

                  * fork repositories


                  #### admin:repository:bitbucket


                  Allows admin activities on repositories. No distinction is
                  made between public and private repositories. This scope does
                  not implicitly grant the `read:repository:bitbucket` or the
                  `write:repository:bitbucket` scopes. It gives access to the
                  admin features of a repository only, not direct access to its
                  contents. This scope does not allow modification of repository
                  permissions. This scope comes with access to the following
                  functionality:

                  * create repository

                  * view repository permissions

                  * view and edit branch restrictions

                  * edit branching model settings

                  * edit default reviewers

                  * view and edit inheritance state for repository settings


                  #### delete:repository:bitbucket

                  Allows deletion of repositories.


                  #### read:pullrequest:bitbucket

                  Allows viewing of pull requests, plus the ability to comment
                  on pull requests.


                  This scope does not imply the `read:repository:bitbucket`
                  scope. With this scope, you could retrieve some data specific
                  to the source/destination repositories of a pull request using
                  pull request endpoints, but it does not give access to
                  repository API endpoints.


                  #### write:pullrequest:bitbucket

                  Allows the ability to create, update, approve, decline, and
                  merge pull requests.


                  This scope does not imply the `write:repository:bitbucket`
                  scope.


                  #### read:project:bitbucket

                  Allows viewing of project and project permission data.


                  #### admin:project:bitbucket

                  Allows the ability to create, update, and delete project. No
                  distinction is made between public and private projects.


                  This scope does not implicitly grant the
                  `read:project:bitbucket` scope or any repository scopes. It
                  gives access to the admin features of a project only, not
                  direct access to its repositories' contents.


                  #### read:workspace:bitbucket

                  Allows viewing of workspace and workspace permission data.


                  #### read:user:bitbucket

                  Allows viewing of user data. This scope is typically required
                  for permission related endpoints.


                  #### read:pipeline:bitbucket

                  Allows read access to all pipeline information (pipelines,
                  steps, caches, artifacts, logs, tests, code-insights).


                  #### write:pipeline:bitbucket

                  Allows running pipelines (i.e., start/stop/create pipeline)
                  and uploading tests/code-insights.


                  This scope does not imply the `read:pipeline:bitbucket` scope.


                  #### admin:pipeline:bitbucket

                  Allows admin activities, such as creating pipeline variables.


                  This scope does not implicitly grant the
                  `read:pipeline:bitbucket` or the `write:pipeline:bitbucket`
                  scopes.


                  #### read:runner:bitbucket

                  Allows viewing of runners information.


                  #### write:runner:bitbucket

                  Allows runners management.


                  This scope does not imply the `read:runners:bitbucket` scope.

                body: "\nYou can query the 2.0 API for specific objects using a simple language which resembles SQL.\n\nNote that filtering and querying by username has been deprecated, due to privacy changes. \nSee the [announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#changes-to-querying) \nfor details.\n\n---\n\n* [Supported endpoints](#supported-endpoints)\n* [Operators](#operators)\n* [Data types](#data-types)\n* [Querying](#querying)\n* [Sorting query results](#sorting-query-results)\n\n----\n\n### Supported endpoints\n\nMost 2.0 API resources that return paginated collections of objects support a single, shared, generic querying language that is used to filter down a result set.\n\nThis includes, but is in no way limited to:\n\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/branches\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/forks\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/src\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/issues\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests\n\nFiltering and sorting supports several distinct operators and data types as well as basic features, like logical operators (AND, OR).\nAs examples, the following queries could be used on the issue tracker endpoint (`/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/issues/`):\n\n\t(state = \"open\" OR state = \"new\") AND assignee = null\n\treporter.nickname != \"evzijst\" AND priority >= \"major\"\n\t(title ~ \"unicode\" OR content.raw ~ \"unicode\") AND created_on > 2015-10-04T14:00:00-07:00\n\nFilter queries can be added to the URL using the q=<query> query parameter. To sort the response, add sort=<field>. Note that the entire query string is put in the q parameter and hence needs to be URL-encoded as shown in the following example:\n\n\t/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"&sort=-updated_on\n\n\n### Operators\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following operators:\n\n| Operator | Definition                     | Example                    |\n|----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| \"=\"      | test for equality              | `nickname = \"evzijst\"`     |\n| \"!=\"     | not equal                      | `is_private != true`       |\n| \"~\"      | case-insensitive text contains | `description ~ \"beef\"`     |\n| \"!~\"     | case-insensitive not contains  | `description !~ \"fubar\"`   |\n| \">\"      | greater than                   | `priority > \"major\"`       |\n| \">=\"     | greater than or equal          | `priority <= \"trivial\"`    |\n| \"<\"      | less than                      | `id < 1234`                |\n| \"<=\"     | less than or equal             | `updated_on <= 2015-03-04` |\n\n### Data types\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following data types:\n\n| Type         | Description                             | Example       |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **String**   | any text inside double quotes           | `\"foo\"`       |\n| **Number**   | arbitrary precision integers and floats | `1, -10.302`  |\n| **Null**     | to test for the absence of a value      | `null`        |\n| **boolean**  | the unquoted strings true or false      | `true, false` |\n| **datetime** | an unquoted [ISO-8601][iso-8601] date time string with the timezone offset, milliseconds and entire time component being optional | `2015-03-04T14:08:59.123+02:00`, `2015-03-04T14:08:59` Date time strings are assumed to be in UTC, unless an explicit timezone offset is provided |\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601]: /iso-8601\n\n### Querying\n\nObjects can be filtered based on their properties. In principle, every element in an object's JSON document schema can be used as a filter criterion.\n\nNote that while the array of objects in a paginated response is wrapped in an\nenvelope with a `values` element, this prefix should not be included in the\nquery fields (so use `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"`, not\n`/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=values.state=\"new\"`).\n\n\n### Examples\n\nFields that contain embedded instances of other object types (e.g. owner is an embedded user object, while parent is an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:\n\n\tparent.owner.nickname = \"bitbucket\"\n\nTo find pull requests which merge into master, come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which I am a reviewer:\n\n```\nsource.repository.full_name != \"main/repo\" AND state = \"OPEN\" AND reviewers.nickname = \"evzijst\" AND destination.branch.name = \"master\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.nickname+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22\n```\n\nTo find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned to anyone:\n\n```\n(state = \"new\" OR state = \"on hold\") AND assignee = null AND component = \"UI\" and updated_on > 2015-11-11T00:00:00-07:00\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/issues?q=%28state+%3D+%22new%22+OR+state+%3D+%22on+hold%22%29+AND+assignee+%3D+null+AND+component+%3D+%22UI%22+and+updated_on+%3E+2015-11-11T00%3A00%3A00-07%3A00\n```\n\nTo find all tags with the string \"2015\" in the name:\n\n```\nname ~ \"2015\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags?q=name+%7E+%222015%22\n```\nOr all my branches:\n\n```\nname ~ \"erik/\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/?q=name+%7E+%22erik%2F%22\n```\n### Sorting query results\n\nYou can sort result sets using the ?sort=<field> query parameter, available on the same resources that support filtering:\n\n* In principle, every field that can be queried can also be used as a key for sorting.\n* By default the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, prefix the field name with a hyphen (e.g. ?sort=-updated_on).\n* Only one field can be sorted on. Compound fields (e.g. sort on state first, followed by updated_on) are not supported.\n\n\n"

                  Endpoints that return collections of objects should always
                  apply pagination.

                  Paginated collections are always wrapped in the following
                  wrapper object:


                  ```json

                  {
                    "size": 5421,
                    "page": 2,
                    "pagelen": 10,
                    "next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3",
                    "previous": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1",
                    "values": [
                      ...
                    ]
                  }

                  ```


                  Pagination is often page-bound, with a query parameter page
                  indicating which

                  page is to be returned.


                  However, clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves
                  by manipulating

                  the page number query parameter. Instead, the response
                  contains a link to the

                  next page. This link should be treated as an opaque location
                  that is not to be

                  constructed by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The
                  only contract

                  around the next link is that it will return the next chunk of
                  results.


                  Lack of a next link in the response indicates the end of the
                  collection.


                  The paginated response contains the following fields:


                  | Field      | Value    |

                  |------------|----------|

                  | `size`     | Total number of objects in the response. This
                  is an optional element that is not provided in all responses,
                  as it can be expensive to compute. |

                  | `page`     | Page number of the current results. This is an
                  optional element that is not provided in all responses. |

                  | `pagelen`  | Current number of objects on the existing page.
                  Globally, the minimum length is 10 and the maximum is 100.
                  Some APIs may specify a different default. |

                  | `next`     | Link to the next page if it exists. The last
                  page of a collection does not have this value. Use this link
                  to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your
                  own URLs. |

                  | `previous` | Link to previous page if it exists. A
                  collections first page does not have this value. This is an
                  optional element that is not provided in all responses. Some
                  result sets strictly support forward navigation and never
                  provide previous links. Clients must anticipate that backwards
                  navigation is not always available. Use this link to navigate
                  the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |

                  | `values`   | The list of objects. This contains at most
                  `pagelen` objects. |


                  The link to the next page is included such that you don't have
                  to hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are
                  guaranteed (except the last page, which lacks next). This is
                  because the previous and size values can be expensive for some
                  data sets.


                  It is important to realize that Bitbucket support both
                  list-based pagination and iterator-based pagination.
                  List-based pagination assumes that the collection is a
                  discrete, immutable, consistently ordered, finite array of
                  objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate a list-based
                  collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket
                  Cloud, list-based responses include the optional size, page,
                  and previous element. The the next and previous links
                  typically resemble something like /foo/bar?page=4.


                  However, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and
                  finite – much like how programming languages tend to
                  distinguish between lists and arrays on one hand and iterators
                  or stream on the other. Where an list-based pagination offers
                  random access into any point in a collection, iterator-based
                  pagination can only navigate forward one element at a time. In
                  Bitbucket such iterator-based pagination contains the next
                  link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily anything else.
                  In these cases, the next link's value often contains an
                  unpredictable hash instead of an explicit page number. The
                  commits resource uses iterator-based pagination.

                body: >

                  By default, each endpoint returns the full representation of a
                  resource and in

                  some cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving
                  a list of pull

                  requests can amount to quite a large document.


                  For better performance, you can ask the server to only return
                  the fields you

                  really need and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial
                  response and to

                  add or remove specific fields from a response, use the
                  `fields` query

                  parameter.



                  ### Example


                  Most API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing
                  to related

                  resources. This saves the client from constructing its own
                  URLs, but is

                  somewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.


                  To significantly reduce the size of the response, use
                  `?fields=-links`:


                  ```json

                  $ curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links

                  {
                    "nickname": "evzijst",
                    "account_status": "active",
                    "website": "",
                    "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
                    "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
                    "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
                    "location": null,
                    "type": "user"
                  }

                  ```


                  ### Fields parameter syntax


                  The `fields` parameter supports 3 modes of operation:


                  1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)

                  2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an
                  endpoint, while
                     still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)
                  3. Omitting all fields, except those specified (e.g.
                  `owner.display_name`)


                  The fields parameter can contain a list of multiple
                  comma-separated field names

                  (e.g. `fields=owner.display_name,uuid,links.self.href`). The
                  parameter itself is

                  not repeated.


                  As discussed at [Condensed Versus Full
                  Objects](serialization#representations),

                  most objects that are embedded inside other objects (like how
                  `owner` is an

                  embedded `user` object in `repository`) appear in "condensed"
                  form that omits

                  many fields. The `fields` parameter allows us to pull in
                  additional fields in

                  such cases.


                  For example, the embedded repository object in a pull request
                  does not normally

                  contain its `owner`. To add that in we can use:

                  `+values.destination.repository.owner`.



                  ### Wildcards


                  The asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular
                  level. For

                  example, removing all entries from the `links` element can be
                  done like this:


                  ```json

                  $ curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*

                  {
                    "nickname": "evzijst",
                    "account_status": "active",
                    "website": "",
                    "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
                    "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
                    "links": {},
                    "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
                    "location": null,
                    "type": "user"
                  }

                  ```


                  Wildcards can be used in combination with exclusion and
                  inclusion. For

                  instance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all elements from the
                  root level and then

                  add in `foo` and `bar`.



                  ### URL encoding


                  Be aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query
                  string, that the

                  "+" must be URL encoded as "%2B" and so the URL will be:


                  ```

                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on

                  ```


                  Without URL escaping, "+" is interpreted as an encoded space
                  which will not

                  match any fields.



                  ### Field discovery


                  While a resource's `self` URL, as well its "collection" URL
                  typically return

                  the full object with all its fields, there are some exceptions
                  for fields that

                  are overly verbose or costly to generate.


                  For instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists of
                  reviewers and

                  participants. These fields are included from the `self` URL,
                  but not from the

                  `/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact
                  performance too much.


                  To discover any additional fields that might not be included
                  by default,

                  `fields=*` can be used.



                  ### More examples


                  If we want to get a list of all reviewer nicknames on pull
                  requests I created,

                  we could combine a [filter](filtering) with a partial
                  response. This will omit

                  all other data from the response:


                  ```

                  /2.0/repositories/bitbucket/bitbucket/pullrequests?fields=values.id,values.reviewers.nickname,values.state&q=author.uuid%3D%22%7Bd301aafa-d676-4ee0-88be-962be7417567%7D%22

                  ### Open API Specification


                  Bitbucket uses the [Open API
                  Specification](https://openapis.org) (OAI,

                  formerly known as Swagger) to describe its APIs. Our OAI
                  specification schema

                  is hosted at
                  [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)

                  and serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive
                  declaration of all

                  available endpoints.


                  The OAI specification makes writing client applications easier
                  by:

                  auto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes)
                  and dealing with

                  authentication and error handling.


                  You can find a comprehensive set of open tools for the OAI
                  specification at:

                  [https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).



                  ### JSON Schema


                  Bitbucket uses JSON Schema to describe the layout of every
                  type of object

                  consumed or produced by the API. These schemas are collected
                  under the

                  `#definitions` element of our swagger.json file.


                  When an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT,
                  it also expects

                  the object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same
                  applies to objects

                  returned by an endpoint.



                  ### Condensed Versus Full Objects


                  Most objects in Bitbucket come both in "full" and "partial"
                  representation.

                  The full representation is when all elements are included.
                  This is the layout

                  returned by a resource's `self` location (e.g.
                  `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),

                  as well as resource collection endpoints (e.g.
                  `/2.0/repositories`).


                  However, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects. For
                  example, a `repository`

                  object embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise, a
                  `pullrequest` object

                  embeds its `repository` object.


                  These related objects are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the
                  "chatter" when

                  clients make frequent followup API calls to collect
                  information on common,

                  related information.


                  Embedded related objects are typically limited in their fields
                  to avoid such

                  object graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often
                  exclude their own

                  nested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between
                  performance and

                  utility.


                  An object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be
                  standardized,

                  meaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of
                  where the object

                  was embedded.

                  You should be familiar with REST architecture before writing
                  an integration. Read this overview page to gain a good
                  understanding of Bitbucket's REST implementation.

                  ### URI structure


                  All Bitbucket Cloud requests start with the
                  `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0 API) and
                  `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).


                  The next segment of the URI path depends on the endpoint of
                  the request. For example, using the curl command and the
                  repositories endpoint you can list all the issues on
                  Bitbucket's tutorial repository:


                  ```

                  curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org

                  ```

                  Given a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a
                  particular aspect or resource of that endpoint. The issues
                  resource on a repository is an example:


                  ```

                  curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues

                  ```


                  #### HTTP methods


                  A given endpoint or resource has a series of actions (or
                  methods) associated with it. The Bitbucket service supports
                  these standard HTTP methods:


                  | Call | Description |

                  |------|-------------|

                  | GET    | Retrieves information. |

                  | PUT    | Updates existing information. |

                  | POST   | Creates new information. |

                  | DELETE | Removes existing information. |


                  For example, you can call use the POST action on the issues
                  resource and create an issue on the issue tracker.


                  **Specifying content length**


                  You can get a `411 Length Required` response. If this happens,
                  the API requires a Content-Length header but the client is not
                  sending it. You should add the header yourself, for example
                  using the curl client:


                  ```

                  curl -r PUT --header "Content-Length: 0" -u user:app_password
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com

                  ```


                  ### Universally Unique Identifier


                  UUID's provide a single point of recognition for users, teams,
                  and repositories. The UUID is distinct from the username, team
                  name, and repository name fields and remains the same even
                  when those fields change. For example when a user changes
                  their username or moves a repository you will need to modify
                  calls which use those identifiers but not if you are pointing
                  to the UUID.


                  #### UUID examples and structure


                  UUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team,
                  and repository objects. The following examples the following
                  characters are replacements for curly brackets: `%7B` replaces
                  `{`  and `%7D` replaces `}`. You will see this structure in
                  the following example sections.


                  #### User object and UUID


                  When you make a call using either the username or the UUID for
                  that user the response is the same.


                  **Call with username**:


                  ```

                  curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials

                  ```


                  ***Call with UUID for the user**:


                  ```

                  curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007%7D

                  ```


                  **Response**

                  }

                  ```


                  #### Repository object and UUID


                  Once you have the UUID for a repository you no longer need a
                  username or team name to make the API call so long as you use
                  an empty field. This helps you resolve repositories no matter
                  if the username or team name changes.


                  **Call with team name (1team) and repository name (moxie)**:


                  ```

                  curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie

                  ```

                  **Call with UUID and empty field**:


                  ```

                  curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/%7B%7D/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D

                  ```


                  **Call with UUID and teamname**:

                  curl

                  #### Team object and UUID


                  This example shows a call for a list of team members using
                  both the team name and with the UUID for the team object. As
                  the call is unauthenticated in the following example the
                  response object will only show members with public profiles.
                  The response is the same in either case.


                  **Call with teamname**


                  ```

                  curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team/members

                  ```

                  **Call with UUID for team object**


                  ```

                  curl
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/%7Baa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2%7D/members

                  ### Standardized error responses


                  The 2.0 API standardizes the error response layout. The 2.0
                  API serves a JSON

                  object along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The JSON
                  object provides a

                  detailed  problem description.


                  ```json

                  {
                      "type": "error",
                      "error": {
                          "message": "Bad request",
                          "fields": {
                              "src": [
                                  "This field is required."
                              ]
                          },
                          "detail": "You must specify a valid source branch when creating a pull request.",
                          "id": "d23a1cc5178f7637f3d9bf2d13824258",
                          "data": {
                            "extra": "Optional, endpoint-specific data to further augment the error."
                          }
                      }
                  }

                  ```


                  This object contains an error element which contains the
                  following nested

                  elements:


                  | Element | Description |

                  |---------|-------------|

                  | message | A short description of the problem. This element
                  is always present. Its value may be localized. |

                  | fields  | This optional element is used in response to POST
                  or PUT operations in which clients have provided invalid
                  input. It contains a list of one or more client-provided
                  fields that failed validation. The values may be localized. |

                  | detail  | An optional detailed explanation of the failure.
                  Its value may be localized.

                  | id      | An optional unique error identifier that
                  identifies the error in Bitbucket's logging system. If you
                  feel you hit a bug in an API and this field is provided,
                  please mention it if you decide to contact support as it will
                  greatly help us narrow down the problem. |


                  ### Standard ISO-8601 timestamps


                  All 2.0 APIs use standardized ISO-8601 timestamps. In most
                  cases, our APIs return UTC timestamps and for these, the
                  timezone offset part will be 00:00. In rare cases where the
                  original localized timestamp has significance, the timezone
                  offset may identify the event's original timezone.

                  (CORS), what content types we support in requests and
                  responses, and hyperlinking resources in each json responses.

                  ### Cors


                  The Bitbucket API supports Cross-origin resource sharing to
                  allow requests for restricted resources across domains. For
                  more information you can refer to:


                  * [Wikipedia article on
                  CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

                  * [W3C CORS recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)


                  Sending a general request from the api to bitbucket.com:


                  `curl -i https://api.bitbucket.org -H "origin:

                  ### Supported content types


                  The default and primary content type for 2.0 APIs is JSON.
                  This applies both to responses from the server and to the
                  request bodies provided by the client.


                  Unless documented otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or
                  modifying an existing (PUT) object, your client must provide
                  the object's normal representation. Not every object element
                  can be mutated. For example, a repository's created_on date is
                  an auto-generated, immutable field. Your client can omit
                  immutable fields from a request body.


                  In some cases, a resource might also accept regular
                  application/x-www-url-form-encoded POST and PUT bodies. Such
                  bodies can be more convenient in scripts and command line
                  usage. Requests bodies can contain contain nested elements or
                  they can be flat (without nested elements). Clients can send
                  flat request bodies as either as application/json or as
                  application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested objects always
                  require JSON.


                  ### Resource links


                  Every 2.0 object contains a links element that points to
                  related resources or alternate representations. Use links to
                  quickly discover and traverse to related objects. Links serve
                  a "self-documenting" function for each endpoint. For example,
                  the following request for a specific user:



                  `$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`


                  ```json

                  {
                      "username": "tutorials",
                      "nickname": "tutorials",
                      "account_status": "active",
                      "website": "https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/",
                      "display_name": "tutorials account",
                      "uuid": "{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}",

                          },
                          "repositories": {
                              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials"
                          },
                          "html": {
                              "href": "https://bitbucket.org/tutorials"
                          },
                          "followers": {
                              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers"
                          },
                          "avatar": {
                              "href": "https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png"
                          },
                          "following": {
                              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following"
                          }
                      },
                      "created_on": "2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00",
                      "location": "Santa Monica, CA",
                      "type": "user"
                  }

                  ```

                  Links can be actual REST API resources or they can be
                  informational. In this example, informative resources include
                  the user's avatar and the HTML URL for the user's Bitbucket
                  account. Your client should avoid hardcoding an API's URL and
                  instead use the URLs returned in API responses.


                  A link's key is its `rel` (relationship) attribute and it
                  contains a mandatory href element. For example, the following
                  link:


                  ```json

                  "self": {
                        "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials"
                  }

                  ```


                  The rel for this link is self and the href is
                  https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials. A single
                  rel key can contain an list (array) of href objects. Your
                  client should anticipate that any rel key can contain one or
                  more href objects.


                  Finally, links can also contain optional elements. Two common
                  optional elements are the name element and the title element.
                  They are often used to disambiguate links that share the same
                  rel key. In the example below, the repository object that
                  contains a clone link with two href objects. Each object
                  contains the optional name element to clarify its use.


                  ```json

                  "links": {
                    "self": {
                      "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/bitbucket"

                  You can use the Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud to build
                  add-ons which

                  can connect with the Bitbucket UI and your own application
                  set. An add-on could

                  be an integration with another existing service, new features
                  for the Atlassian

                  application, or even a new product that runs within the
                  Atlassian application.
