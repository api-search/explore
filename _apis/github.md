    description: >-
      To create integrations, retrieve data, and automate your workflows, build
      with the GitHub REST API. When you make a request to the REST API, you
      will specify an HTTP method and a path. Additionally, you might also
      specify request headers and path, query, or body parameters. The API will
      return the response status code, response headers, and potentially a
      response body.

                description: >-
                  Creates an installation access token that enables a GitHub App
                  to make authenticated API requests for the app's installation
                  on an organization or individual account. Installation tokens
                  expire one hour from the time you create them. Using an
                  expired token produces a status code of `401 - Unauthorized`,
                  and requires creating a new installation token. By default the
                  installation token has access to all repositories that the
                  installation can access. 


                  Optionally, you can use the `repositories` or `repository_ids`
                  body parameters to specify individual repositories that the
                  installation access token can access. If you don't use
                  `repositories` or `repository_ids` to grant access to specific
                  repositories, the installation access token will have access
                  to all repositories that the installation was granted access
                  to. The installation access token cannot be granted access to
                  repositories that the installation was not granted access to.
                  Up to 500 repositories can be listed in this manner.


                  Optionally, use the `permissions` body parameter to specify
                  the permissions that the installation access token should
                  have. If `permissions` is not specified, the installation
                  access token will have all of the permissions that were
                  granted to the app. The installation access token cannot be
                  granted permissions that the app was not granted.


                  When using the repository or permission parameters to reduce
                  the access of the token, the complexity of the token is
                  increased due to both the number of permissions in the request
                  and the number of repositories the token will have access to.
                  If the complexity is too large, the token will fail to be
                  issued. If this occurs, the error message will indicate the
                  maximum number of repositories that should be requested. For
                  the average application requesting 8 permissions, this limit
                  is around 5000 repositories. With fewer permissions requested,
                  more repositories are supported.

                  If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic
                  Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a
                  one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead

                  To create tokens for a particular OAuth application using this
                  endpoint, you must authenticate as the user you want to create
                  an authorization for and provide the app's client ID and
                  secret, found on your OAuth application's settings page. If
                  your OAuth application intends to create multiple tokens for
                  one user, use `fingerprint` to differentiate between them.


                  You can also create tokens on GitHub Enterprise Server from
                  the [personal access tokens
                  settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page. Read more
                  about these tokens in [the GitHub Help
                  documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).


                  Organizations that enforce SAML SSO require personal access
                  tokens to be allowed. For more information, see "[About
                  identity and access management with SAML single

                  which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens
                  and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using
                  our [web application

                  If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic
                  Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a
                  one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead
                  of tokens. For more information, see "[Working with two-factor

                  You can only send one of these scope keys at a time.

                  GitHub Enterprise Server provides several timeline resources
                  in [Atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard))
                  format. The Feeds API lists all the feeds available to the
                  authenticated user:


                  *   **Timeline**: The GitHub Enterprise Server global public
                  timeline

                  *   **User**: The public timeline for any user, using
                  `uri_template`. For more information, see
                  "[Hypermedia](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#hypermedia)."

                  *   **Current user public**: The public timeline for the
                  authenticated user

                  *   **Current user**: The private timeline for the
                  authenticated user

                  *   **Current user actor**: The private timeline for activity
                  created by the authenticated user

                  *   **Current user organizations**: The private timeline for
                  the organizations the authenticated user is a member of.

                  *   **Security advisories**: A collection of public
                  announcements that provide information about security-related
                  vulnerabilities in software on GitHub Enterprise Server.


                  **Note**: Private feeds are only returned when [authenticating
                  via Basic
                  Auth](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication)
                  since current feed URIs use the older, non revocable auth
                  tokens.

                  Once an installation token is revoked, the token is
                  invalidated and cannot be used. Other endpoints that require
                  the revoked installation token must have a new installation
                  token to work. You can create a new token using the "[Create

                  app](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/apps/apps#create-an-installation-access-token-for-an-app)"

                  necessarily assigned to you.


                  **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an
                  issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this

                  reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull
                  requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by

                  the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull
                  request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue
                  id_. To find out the pull

                  request id, use the "[List pull
                  requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)"

                  **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an
                  issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this

                  reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull
                  requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by

                  the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull
                  request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue
                  id_. To find out the pull

                  request id, use the "[List pull
                  requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)"

                  organization owner. If the authenticated user changes an
                  owner's role to `member`, no email will be sent.


                  **Rate limits**


                  To prevent abuse, the authenticated user is limited to 50
                  organization invitations per 24 hour period. If the
                  organization is more than one month old or on a paid plan, the
                  limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour period.

                  Team synchronization is available for organizations using
                  GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
                  products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
                  in the GitHub Help documentation.


                  **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team
                  with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see
                  an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to
                  the team's membership. If you have access to manage group
                  membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise
                  Server team membership through your identity provider, which
                  automatically adds and removes team members in an
                  organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams
                  between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise
                  Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."


                  An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the
                  team's organization to a team. When an organization owner adds
                  someone to a team who is not an organization member, this
                  endpoint will send an invitation to the person via email. This
                  newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until
                  the person accepts the invitation, at which point the
                  membership will transition to the "active" state and the user
                  will be added as a member of the team.


                  If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint
                  will update the role of the team member's role. To update the
                  membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an
                  organization owner or a team maintainer.


                  **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and
                  `team_id` using the route `PUT
                  /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

                  the team and project, or `admin` access to the team or

                  inherited through a parent team will also be checked.


                  You can also get information about the specified repository,
                  including what permissions the team grants on it, by passing
                  the following custom [media

                  header.


                  If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will
                  receive a `404 Not Found` response status.


                  If the repository is private, you must have at least `read`
                  permission for that repository, and your token must have the
                  `repo` or `admin:org` scope. Otherwise, you will receive a
                  `404 Not Found` response status.

                  Some categories of endpoints have custom rate limits that are
                  separate from the rate limit governing the other REST API
                  endpoints. For this reason, the API response categorizes your
                  rate limit. Under `resources`, you'll see objects relating to
                  different categories:

                  * The `core` object provides your rate limit status for all
                  non-search-related resources in the REST API.

                  * The `search` object provides your rate limit status for the
                  REST API for searching (excluding code searches). For more
                  information, see
                  "[Search](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search)."

                  * The `code_search` object provides your rate limit status for
                  the REST API for searching code. For more information, see
                  "[Search
                  code](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search#search-code)."

                  * The `graphql` object provides your rate limit status for the

                  **Note:** Although the API responds immediately, the branch
                  rename process might take some extra time to complete in the
                  background. You won't be able to push to the old branch name
                  while the rename process is in progress. For more information,

                  The authenticated user must have push access to the branch. If
                  the branch is the default branch, the authenticated user must
                  also have admin or owner permissions.


                  In order to rename the default branch, fine-grained access
                  tokens also need the `administration:write` repository
                  permission.

                  To create a check run, you must use a GitHub App. OAuth apps
                  and authenticated users are not able to create a check suite.


                  In a check suite, GitHub limits the number of check runs with
                  the same name to 1000. Once these check runs exceed 1000,
                  GitHub will start to automatically delete older check runs.

                  repository where the check suite or check run were created.

                description: >-
                  Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository.


                  You can delete one analysis at a time.

                  To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent
                  analysis and work backwards.

                  Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a
                  text editor.


                  When you list the analyses for a repository,

                  one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:


                  ```

                  "deletable": true

                  ```


                  An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of
                  analyses.

                  Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses

                  for each enabled code scanning tool,

                  where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis
                  values:


                  * `ref`

                  * `tool`

                  * `category`


                  If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most
                  recent in a set,

                  you'll get a 400 response with the message:


                  ```

                  Analysis specified is not deletable.

                  ```


                  The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you
                  with

                  two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the
                  set:

                  `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.

                  Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid
                  accidentally deleting the final analysis

                  in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at
                  least one analysis

                  for the specified tool in your repository.

                  Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove
                  all analyses for a tool.

                  When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of
                  `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`

                  in the 200 response is `null`.


                  As an example of the deletion process,

                  let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a
                  particular code scanning tool

                  to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15
                  analyses:

                  10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.

                  You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this
                  tool.

                  You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses
                  for the tool.

                  To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.

                  To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as
                  deletable.

                  Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as
                  deletable.

                  Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,

                  delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next
                  analysis in the set until they're all deleted.

                  Then repeat the process for the second set.

                  The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:


                  **Outer loop**:

                  * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.

                  * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:

                    **Inner loop**:
                    * Delete the identified analysis.
                    * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.

                  The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of
                  the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the
                  specified repository, and it therefore uses the
                  `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the
                  `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis
                  in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis
                  entirely.

For troubleshooting information, see \"[Troubleshooting SARIF uploads](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif).\"\n\nThere are two places where you can upload code scanning results.\n - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see \"[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests).\"\n - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see \"[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository).\"\n\nYou must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:\n\n```\ngzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0\n```\n\nSARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.\nTo get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries.

                  There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to
                  organization members when an organization base role is in
                  place. In this case, the permission being given must be equal
                  to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the
                  request will fail with:


                  ```

                  Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}

                  ```


                  Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll

                  The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an
                  existing collaborator without first removing and re-adding the
                  collaborator. To change the permissions, use the same endpoint
                  and pass a different `permission` parameter. The response will
                  be a `204`, with no other indication that the permission level
                  changed.

                  To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must either be an
                  administrator of the repository or target themselves for
                  removal.


                  This endpoint also:

                  - Cancels any outstanding invitations

                  - Unasigns the user from any issues

                  - Removes access to organization projects if the user is not
                  an organization member and is not a collaborator on any other
                  organization repositories.

                  - Unstars the repository

                  - Updates access permissions to packages


                  Removing a user as a collaborator has the following effects on
                  forks:
                   - If the user had access to a fork through their membership to this repository, the user will also be removed from the fork.
                   - If the user had their own fork of the repository, the fork will be deleted.
                   - If the user still has read access to the repository, open pull requests by this user from a fork will be denied.

                  **Note**: A user can still have access to the repository
                  through organization permissions like base repository
                  permissions.


                  Although the API responds immediately, the additional
                  permission updates might take some extra time to complete in
                  the background.

                  *Note*: The `permission` attribute provides the legacy base
                  roles of `admin`, `write`, `read`, and `none`, where the

                  mapped to `read`. To determine the role assigned to the

                  collaborator, see the `role_name` attribute, which will
                  provide the full role name, including custom roles. The

                  `permissions` hash can also be used to determine which base
                  level of access the collaborator has to the repository.

                  Lists check runs for a commit ref. The `ref` can be a SHA,
                  branch name, or a tag name.


                  **Note:** The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes
                  in the repository where the check suite or check run were
                  created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not
                  detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.


                  If there are more than 1000 check suites on a single git
                  reference, this endpoint will limit check runs to the 1000
                  most recent check suites. To iterate over all possible check
                  runs, use the [List check suites for a Git
                  reference](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/reference/checks#list-check-suites-for-a-git-reference)
                  endpoint and provide the `check_suite_id` parameter to the
                  [List check runs in a check
                  suite](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/reference/checks#list-check-runs-in-a-check-suite)
                  endpoint.


                  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
                  `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.

                  Lists check suites for a commit `ref`. The `ref` can be a SHA,
                  branch name, or a tag name.


                  **Note:** The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes
                  in the repository where the check suite or check run were
                  created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not
                  detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a
                  `null` value for `head_branch`.


                  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
                  `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.

                  Users with pull access in a repository can access a combined
                  view of commit statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA,
                  a branch name, or a tag name.



                  Additionally, a combined `state` is returned. The `state` is
                  one of:


                  *   **failure** if any of the contexts report as `error` or
                  `failure`

                  *   **pending** if there are no statuses or a context is
                  `pending`

                  *   **success** if the latest status for all contexts is

                  Users with pull access in a repository can view commit
                  statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA, a branch name,
                  or a tag name. Statuses are returned in reverse chronological
                  order. The first status in the list will be the latest one.


                  This resource is also available via a legacy route: `GET
                  /repos/:owner/:repo/statuses/:ref`.

                description: >-
                  Compares two commits against one another. You can compare refs
                  (branches or tags) and commit SHAs in the same repository, or
                  you can compare refs and commit SHAs that exist in different
                  repositories within the same repository network, including
                  fork branches. For more information about how to view a
                  repository's network, see "[Understanding connections between
                  repositories](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)."


                  This endpoint is equivalent to running the `git log
                  BASE..HEAD` command, but it returns commits in a different
                  order. The `git log BASE..HEAD` command returns commits in
                  reverse chronological order, whereas the API returns commits
                  in chronological order.


                  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For
                  more information, see "[Media
                  types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


                  - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the
                  commit.

                  - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the
                  commit. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.


                  The API response includes details about the files that were
                  changed between the two commits. This includes the status of
                  the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or
                  renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files
                  with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field
                  showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a
                  `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes
                  made to the file.


                  When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter
                  (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250
                  commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of
                  the entire comparison.


                  **Working with large comparisons**


                  To process a response with a large number of commits, use a
                  query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the
                  results. When using pagination:


                  - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of
                  results, but it includes all changed files for the entire
                  comparison.

                  - The results are returned in chronological order, but the
                  last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent
                  one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.


                  For more information on working with pagination, see "[Using
                  pagination in the REST
                  API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."


                  **Signature verification object**


                  The response will include a `verification` object that
                  describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The
                  `verification` object includes the following fields:


                  | Name | Type | Description |

                  | ---- | ---- | ----------- |

                  | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers
                  the signature in this commit to be verified. |

                  | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value.
                  Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table
                  below. |

                  | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted
                  from the commit. |

                  | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |


                  These are the possible values for `reason` in the
                  `verification` object:


                  | Value | Description |

                  | ----- | ----------- |

                  | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired.
                  |

                  | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the
                  usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |

                  | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with
                  the signature verification service. |

                  | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service
                  is currently unavailable. |

                  | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |

                  | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in
                  the commit. |

                  | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer`
                  email address in the commit. |

                  | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the
                  commit was associated with a user, but the email address is
                  not verified on their account. |

                  | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is
                  not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the
                  signature. |

                  | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
                  registered with any user's account. |

                  | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the
                  signature. |

                  | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically
                  verified using the key whose key-id was found in the
                  signature. |

                  | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature
                  is considered to be verified. |

                  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For
                  more information, see "[Media
                  types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


                  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file
                  contents for files and symlinks.

                  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file
                  contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using
                  GitHub's open-source [Markup
                  library](https://github.com/github/markup).

                  - **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the
                  contents in a consistent object format regardless of the
                  content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for
                  a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries`
                  attribute containing the array of objects.


                  If the content is a directory, the response will be an array
                  of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When
                  listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their
                  "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value _should_ be
                  "submodule". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility
                  purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of
                  the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".


                  If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a
                  normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the
                  content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an
                  object describing the symlink itself.


                  If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field
                  identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the
                  `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule
                  repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule
                  repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific
                  commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on
                  github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and
                  the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will
                  have null values.


                  **Notes**:


                  - To get a repository's contents recursively, you can
                  [recursively get the
                  tree](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).

                  - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory.
                  If you need to retrieve

                  more files, use the [Git Trees
                  API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).

                  - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To
                  ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the
                  contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.

                  - If the requested file's size is:
                    - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
                    - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty
                  string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the
                  contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
                    - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.

                  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
                  `repo` scope to use this endpoint. The `workflow` scope is
                  also required in order to modify files in the

                  You can provide an additional `committer` parameter, which is
                  an object containing information about the committer. Or, you
                  can provide an `author` parameter, which is an object
                  containing information about the author.


                  The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the
                  `committer` information if omitted. If the `committer`
                  information is omitted, the authenticated user's information
                  is used.


                  You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether
                  you choose to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll
                  receive a `422` status code.

                  Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain
                  defaults.


                  The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At
                  GitHub Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify
                  them

                  before we merge a pull request.


                  The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to
                  different runtime environments. Teams often have

                  multiple environments for verifying their applications, such
                  as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter

                  makes it easier to track which environments have requested
                  deployments. The default environment is `production`.


                  The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the
                  requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch.
                  If

                  the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we
                  will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,

                  the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge
                  conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will

                  return a failure response.


                  By default, [commit
                  statuses](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/commits/statuses)
                  for every submitted context must be in a `success`

                  state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify
                  a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to

                  specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not
                  required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do

                  not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the
                  deployment will always succeed.


                  The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information
                  that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text

                  field that will be passed on when a deployment event is
                  dispatched.


                  The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow
                  different execution paths. In the web world this might

                  be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In
                  the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an

                  application with debugging enabled.


                  Merged branch response:


                  You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges
                  the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating

                  a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:

                  *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository

                  *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the
                  base branch, which is `master` in the response example

                  *   There are no merge conflicts


                  If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request
                  to create a deployment should give a successful

                  response.


                  Merge conflict response:


                  This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and
                  when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't

                  be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case
                  `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.


                  Failed commit status checks:


                  This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter
                  indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`

                  status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the
                  required contexts do not have a state of `success`.


                  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
                  `repo` or `repo_deployment` scope to use this endpoint.

                  If the repository only has one deployment, you can delete the
                  deployment regardless of its status. If the repository has
                  more than one deployment, you can only delete inactive
                  deployments. This ensures that repositories with multiple
                  deployments will always have an active deployment.


                  To set a deployment as inactive, you must:


                  *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system
                  has a record of the current state, then delete the previously
                  active deployment.

                  *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any
                  non-successful deployment status.

                  `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example
                  `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see
                  "[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch)."


                  The `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra
                  information that your workflow might need. This parameter is a
                  JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is
                  dispatched. For example, the `client_payload` can include a
                  message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions
                  workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to
                  debug your workflow.


                  This input example shows how you can use the `client_payload`
                  as a test to debug your workflow.

                summary: List matching references
                description: >-
                  Returns an array of references from your Git database that
                  match the supplied name. The `:ref` in the URL must be
                  formatted as `heads/<branch name>` for branches and `tags/<tag
                  name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't exist in the
                  repository, but existing refs start with `:ref`, they will be
                  returned as an array.


                  When you use this endpoint without providing a `:ref`, it will
                  return an array of all the references from your Git database,
                  including notes and stashes if they exist on the server.
                  Anything in the namespace is returned, not just `heads` and
                  `tags`.


                  **Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull
                  request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request)
                  to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability
                  of pull requests. For more information, see "[Checking
                  mergeability of pull
                  requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".


                  If you request matching references for a branch named
                  `feature` but the branch `feature` doesn't exist, the response
                  can still include other matching head refs that start with the
                  word `feature`, such as `featureA` and `featureB`.

                  branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't
                  match an existing ref, a `404` is returned.

                  The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify
                  both a tree and a nested path modifying that tree, this
                  endpoint will overwrite the contents of the tree with the new
                  path contents, and create a new tree structure.


                  If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file
                  contents in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then
                  update a branch to point to the commit. For more information

                  **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an

                  the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull
                  request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue
                  id_. To find out the pull

                  request id, use the "[List pull

                  You can request that your site be built from the latest

                  Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with
                  GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and
                  legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private
                  repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For
                  more information, see [GitHub's
                  products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
                  in the GitHub Help documentation.


                  Lists details of a pull request by providing its number.


                  When you get,
                  [create](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls/#create-a-pull-request),
                  or
                  [edit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#update-a-pull-request)
                  a pull request, GitHub Enterprise Server creates a merge
                  commit to test whether the pull request can be automatically
                  merged into the base branch. This test commit is not added to
                  the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status
                  of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more
                  information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull
                  requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".


                  The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`,
                  or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub Enterprise
                  Server has started a background job to compute the
                  mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit
                  the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null`
                  value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If
                  `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA
                  of the _test_ merge commit.


                  The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes
                  depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a
                  pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA
                  of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the
                  `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you
                  merged the pull request:


                  *   If merged as a [merge
                  commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/),
                  `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.

                  *   If merged via a
                  [squash](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits),
                  `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit
                  on the base branch.

                  *   If
                  [rebased](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits),
                  `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch
                  was updated to.


                  Pass the appropriate [media
                  type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests)

                  Pull request reviews created in the `PENDING` state are not
                  submitted and therefore do not include the `submitted_at`
                  property in the response. To create a pending review for a
                  pull request, leave the `event` parameter blank. For more
                  information about submitting a `PENDING` review, see "[Submit

                  **Note:** To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to
                  first determine the position of that line in the diff. To see
                  a pull request diff, add the `application/vnd.github.v3.diff`
                  media type to the `Accept` header of a call to the [Get a pull
                  request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request)
                  endpoint.


                  The `position` value equals the number of lines down from the
                  first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a comment.
                  The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line
                  is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues
                  to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks
                  until the beginning of a new file.

                  This endpoint makes use of a [Hypermedia
                  relation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#hypermedia)
                  to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to
                  upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the
                  `upload_url` returned in

                  the response of the [Create a release
                  endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release)
                  to upload a release asset.


                  You need to use an HTTP client which supports
                  [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to
                  make calls to this endpoint.


                  Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header
                  automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to
                  provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media
                  types, see [Media
                  Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
                  For example: 


                  `application/zip`


                  GitHub Enterprise Server expects the asset data in its raw
                  binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary
                  content of the asset as the request body. Everything else
                  about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For
                  example,

                  you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to
                  upload an asset.


                  When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad
                  Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of
                  `starter`. It can be safely deleted.


                  **Notes:**

                  *   GitHub Enterprise Server renames asset filenames that have
                  special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading
                  or trailing periods. The "[List release
                  assets](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"

                  endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and
                  help, contact [GitHub Enterprise Server
                  Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).

                  *   To find the `release_id` query the [`GET
                  /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`
                  endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release). 

                  *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another
                  uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the
                  old file before you can re-upload the new asset.

                  Creates an external identity for a new SCIM enterprise user.


                  SCIM does not authenticate users, it only provisions them. The
                  authentication of users is done by SAML. However, when SCIM is
                  enabled, all users need to be provisioned through SCIM before
                  a user can sign in through SAML. The matching of a user to a
                  SCIM provisioned user is done when the SAML assertion is
                  consumed. The user will be matched on SAML response `NameID`
                  to SCIM `userName`.


                  When converting existing enterprise to use SCIM, the user
                  handle (`userName`) from the SCIM payload will be used to
                  match the provisioned user to an already existing user in the
                  enterprise. Since the new identity record is created for newly
                  provisioned users the matching for those records is done using
                  a user's handle. Currently the matching will be performed to
                  all of the users no matter if they were SAML JIT provisioned
                  or created as local users.

                  For example, if you want to find the definition of the

                  [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your
                  query would look something like this:


                  `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`


                  This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's
                  contents. The query limits the search to files where the
                  language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.


                  Considerations for code search:


                  Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few
                  restrictions on how searches are performed:


                  *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases,
                  this will be the `master` branch.

                  *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.

                  *   You must always include at least one search term when
                  searching source code. For example, searching for
                  [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code)
                  is not valid, while [`amazing

                  language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code)

                  Find issues by state and keyword. This method returns up to
                  100 results [per
                  page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).


                  When searching for issues, you can get text match metadata for
                  the issue **title**, issue **body**, and issue **comment
                  body** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For
                  more details about how to receive highlighted

                  search results, see [Text match
                  metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).


                  For example, if you want to find the oldest unresolved Python
                  bugs on Windows. Your query might look something like this.


                  `q=windows+label:bug+language:python+state:open&sort=created&order=asc`


                  This query searches for the keyword `windows`, within any open
                  issue that is labeled as `bug`. The search runs across
                  repositories whose primary language is Python. The results are
                  sorted by creation date in ascending order, which means the
                  oldest issues appear first in the search results.


                  **Note:** For requests made by GitHub Apps with a user access
                  token, you can't retrieve a combination of issues and pull
                  requests in a single query. Requests that don't include the
                  `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` qualifier will receive an HTTP
                  `422 Unprocessable Entity` response. To get results for both
                  issues and pull requests, you must send separate queries for
                  issues and pull requests. For more information about the `is`
                  qualifier, see "[Searching only issues or pull
                  requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-only-issues-or-pull-requests)."

                  When searching for labels, you can get text match metadata for
                  the label **name** and **description** fields when you pass

                  For example, if you want to find labels in the `linguist`
                  repository that match `bug`, `defect`, or `enhancement`. Your
                  query might look like this:


                  `q=bug+defect+enhancement&repository_id=64778136`


                  The labels that best match the query appear first in the

                  For example, if you want to search for popular Tetris
                  repositories written in assembly code, your query might look
                  like this:


                  `q=tetris+language:assembly&sort=stars&order=desc`


                  This query searches for repositories with the word `tetris` in
                  the name, the description, or the README. The results are
                  limited to repositories where the primary language is
                  assembly. The results are sorted by stars in descending order,
                  so that the most popular repositories appear first in the
                  search results.

                  When searching for topics, you can get text match metadata for
                  the topic's **short\_description**, **description**, **name**,
                  or **display\_name** field when you pass the `text-match`

                  For example, if you want to search for topics related to Ruby

                  For example, if you're looking for a list of popular users,
                  you might try this query:


                  `q=tom+repos:%3E42+followers:%3E1000`


                  This query searches for users with the name `tom`. The results

                  over 1,000 followers.


                  This endpoint does not accept authentication and will only
                  include publicly visible users. As an alternative, you can use
                  the GraphQL API. The GraphQL API requires authentication and
                  will return private users, including Enterprise Managed Users

                description: >-
                  When you boot a GitHub instance for the first time, you can
                  use the following endpoint to upload a license.


                  Note that you need to `POST` to
                  [`/setup/api/configure`](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console#start-a-configuration-process)
                  to start the actual configuration process.


                  When using this endpoint, your GitHub instance must have a
                  password set. This can be accomplished two ways:


                  1.  If you're working directly with the API before accessing
                  the web interface, you must pass in the password parameter to
                  set your password.

                  2.  If you set up your instance via the web interface before
                  accessing the API, your calls to this endpoint do not need the
                  password parameter.


                  **Note:** The request body for this operation must be
                  submitted as `multipart/form-data` data. You can can reference
                  the license file by prefixing the filename with the `@` symbol
                  using `curl`. For more information, see the [`curl`
                  documentation](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-F).

                  **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team
                  with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see

                  Server team membership through your identity provider, which
                  automatically adds and removes team members in an

                  The "Remove team member" endpoint (described below) is
                  deprecated.


                  We recommend using the [Remove team membership for a
                  user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/teams/members#remove-team-membership-for-a-user)
                  endpoint instead. It allows you to remove both active and
                  pending memberships.


                  Team synchronization is available for organizations using
                  GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
                  products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
                  in the GitHub Help documentation.


                  To remove a team member, the authenticated user must have
                  'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the org that
                  the team is associated with. Removing a team member does not
                  delete the user, it just removes them from the team.


                  **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team
                  with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see

                  If the user is already a member of the team's organization,
                  this endpoint will add the user to the team. To add a
                  membership between an organization member and a team, the
                  authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team
                  maintainer.

                  If the user is unaffiliated with the team's organization, this
                  endpoint will send an invitation to the user via email. This
                  newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until
                  the user accepts the invitation, at which point the membership
                  will transition to the "active" state and the user will be
                  added as a member of the team. To add a membership between an
                  unaffiliated user and a team, the authenticated user must be
                  an organization owner.


                  If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint
                  will update the role of the team member's role. To update the
                  membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an
                  organization owner or a team maintainer.

                  **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an
                  issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this

                  reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull
                  requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by

                  the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull
                  request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue
                  id_. To find out the pull

                  request id, use the "[List pull
                  requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)"

                  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML

                  with `read:org` scope, you can publicize your organization
                  membership with `user` scope, etc.). Therefore, this API
                  requires at least `user` or `read:org` scope for OAuth app
                  tokens and personal access tokens (classic). Requests with
                  insufficient scope will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

                  Restores a specific package version for a user.


                  You can restore a deleted package under the following
                  conditions:
                    - The package was deleted within the last 30 days.
                    - The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.

                  If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry
                  that supports granular permissions, the authenticated user
                  must have admin permissions to the package. For the list of
                  these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub
                  Packages](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."


                  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
                  `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes to use this
                  endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages
                  registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, the
                  `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these
                  registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub
                  Packages](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

                  API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api)."
                  For information about the APIs to manage check runs, see [the
                  GraphQL API
                  documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/graphql/reference/objects#checkrun)
                  or "[Check
                  Runs](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/checks/runs)"
                  in the REST API documentation.


                  For activity relating to check suites, use the `check-suite`
                  event.


                  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least
                  read-level access for the "Checks" repository permission. To
                  receive the `rerequested` and `requested_action` event types,
                  the app must have at least write-level access for the "Checks"
                  permission. GitHub Apps with write-level access for the
                  "Checks" permission are automatically subscribed to this
                  webhook event.


                  Repository and organization webhooks only receive payloads for
                  the `created` and `completed` event types in repositories.


                  **Note**: The API only looks for pushes in the repository
                  where the check run was created. Pushes to a branch in a
                  forked repository are not detected and return an empty
                  `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.

                  in the REST API documentation.


                  For activity relating to check runs, use the `check_run`
                  event.


                  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least
                  read-level access for the "Checks" permission. To receive the
                  `requested` and `rerequested` event types, the app must have
                  at least write-level access for the "Checks" permission.
                  GitHub Apps with write-level access for the "Checks"
                  permission are automatically subscribed to this webhook event.


                  Repository and organization webhooks only receive payloads for
                  the `completed` event types in repositories.


                  **Note**: The API only looks for pushes in the repository
                  where the check suite was created. Pushes to a branch in a
                  forked repository are not detected and return an empty
                  `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.

                  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least
                  read-level access for the "Contents" repository permission.


                  **Notes**:

                  - This event will not occur when more than three tags are
                  created at once.

                  - Payloads are capped at 25 MB. If an event generates a larger
                  payload, GitHub will not deliver a payload for that webhook
                  event. This may happen, for example, if many branches or tags
                  are pushed at once. We suggest monitoring your payload size to
                  ensure delivery.

                  A GitHub App receives this webhook by default and cannot
                  unsubscribe from this event.


                  Anyone can revoke their authorization of a GitHub App from
                  their [GitHub account settings
                  page](https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations).
                  Revoking the authorization of a GitHub App does not uninstall
                  the GitHub App. You should program your GitHub App so that
                  when it receives this webhook, it stops calling the API on
                  behalf of the person who revoked the token. If your GitHub App
                  continues to use a revoked access token, it will receive the
                  `401 Bad Credentials` error. For details about requests with a
                  user access token, which require GitHub App authorization, see

                  If you want to receive an event when an issue or pull request
                  is added to or removed from a milestone, use the `milestoned`
                  or `demilestoned` action type for the `issues` or
                  `pull_request` events instead.


                  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least
                  read-level access for the "Issues" or "Pull requests"
                  repository permissions.

                  relating to the new Projects experience, use the `projects_v2`

                  This event occurs when there is activity relating to an item

                  For activity relating to a project (instead of an item on a
                  project), use the `projects_v2` event. For activity relating

                  `project_column` events instead.


                  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least
                  read-level access for the "Projects" organization permission.

                  `project_column` events instead.

                  For activity relating to a item on a project, use the
                  `projects_v2_item` event. For activity relating to Projects
                  (classic), use the `project`, `project_card`, and
                  `project_column` events instead.


                  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least
                  read-level access for the "Projects" organization permission.
