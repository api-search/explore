description: >-
  Planet has a range of APIs for discovering imagery, ordering bundles of
  imagery and analytic products, setting up subscriptions, and delivering that
  data to your preferred cloud.To start working with Planet's APIs, you first
  register and obtain an API key from your account. This key grants you access
  to a variety of APIs, such as the Data API for searching Planet's data
  catalog, Orders API for creating analysis-ready data, and Subscriptions API
  for subscribing and monitoring continuous cloud delivery of imagery and
  metadata collections. Remember, you first need to activate an imagery first,
  then monitor its status until it's ready for download or delivery to the
  cloud. ~ https://developers.planet.com/quickstart/apis/
