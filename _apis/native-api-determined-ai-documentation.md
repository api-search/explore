  The Native API allows developers to seamlessly move between training in a
  local development environment and training at cluster-scale on a Determined
  cluster. It also provides an interface to train tf.keras and tf.estimator
  models using idiomatic framework patterns, reducing (or eliminating) the
  effort to port model code for use with Determined. ~
