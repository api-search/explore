  Application Programming Interface (API) is an intermediary that allows
  applications to access the features or data of another application or system.
  Our API allows users to programmatically process satellite data and integrate
  it into their own applications. You can choose between an OGC (Open Geospatial
  Consortium) API that allows you to integrate satellite data into your desktop
  or online applications using the standard WMS, WCS, WMTS and WFS services, or
  a more powerful Sentinel Hub RESTful API. Watch the OGC webinar and the
  Process API webinar to get started. ~
