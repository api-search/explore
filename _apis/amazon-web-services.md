      <p>Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps you to set,
      verify, and refine your IAM policies by providing a suite of capabilities.
      Its features include findings for external and unused access, basic and
      custom policy checks for validating policies, and policy generation to
      generate fine-grained policies. To start using IAM Access Analyzer to
      identify external or unused access, you first need to create an
      analyzer.</p> <p> <b>External access analyzers</b> help identify potential
      risks of accessing resources by enabling you to identify any resource
      policies that grant access to an external principal. It does this by using
      logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon
      Web Services environment. An external principal can be another Amazon Web
      Services account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an
      Amazon Web Services service, or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM
      Access Analyzer to preview public and cross-account access to your
      resources before deploying permissions changes.</p> <p> <b>Unused access
      analyzers</b> help identify potential identity access risks by enabling
      you to identify unused IAM roles, unused access keys, unused console
      passwords, and IAM principals with unused service and action-level
      permissions.</p> <p>Beyond findings, IAM Access Analyzer provides basic
      and custom policy checks to validate IAM policies before deploying
      permissions changes. You can use policy generation to refine permissions
      by attaching a policy generated using access activity logged in CloudTrail
      logs. </p> <p>This guide describes the IAM Access Analyzer operations that
      you can call programmatically. For general information about IAM Access
      Analyzer, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">Identity
      and Access Management Access Analyzer</a> in the <b>IAM User

      <p>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless,
      Prometheus-compatible monitoring service for container metrics that makes
      it easier to securely monitor container environments at scale. With Amazon
      Managed Service for Prometheus, you can use the same open-source
      Prometheus data model and query language that you use today to monitor the
      performance of your containerized workloads, and also enjoy improved
      scalability, availability, and security without having to manage the
      underlying infrastructure.</p> <p>For more information about Amazon
      Managed Service for Prometheus, see the <a

      <p>This is the <i>Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority API
      Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for
      each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a
      private certificate authority (CA) for your organization.</p> <p>The
      documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the
      JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
      SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
      platform that you prefer. For more information, see <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services
      SDKs</a>.</p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services Private CA API operation has a
      quota that determines the number of times the operation can be called per
      second. Amazon Web Services Private CA throttles API requests at different
      rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that Amazon Web
      Services Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request
      exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When
      a request is throttled, Amazon Web Services Private CA returns a <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException</a>
      error. Amazon Web Services Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request
      rate for APIs. </p> <p>To see an up-to-date list of your Amazon Web
      Services Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase, log into your
      Amazon Web Services account and visit the <a
      href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/">Service Quotas</a>

                  can update it. You can disable a private CA that is in the

      <p>Use AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to
      create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations. AppConfig
      supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes
      built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with
      applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile
      applications, or IoT devices.</p> <p>To prevent errors when deploying
      application configurations, especially for production systems where a
      simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes
      validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure
      that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate
      your application configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web
      Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The
      configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration
      data is valid.</p> <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig
      monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If
      the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to
      minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment
      strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment
      criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to
      error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig
      automatically rolls back to the previous version. </p> <p>AppConfig
      supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a
      timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement. </p> </li>
      <li> <p> <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce
      changes to your application that can only be tested with production
      traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow
      premium subscribers to access paid content. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your
      application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the
      system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the

      <p>AppConfig Data provides the data plane APIs your application uses to
      retrieve configuration data. Here's how it works:</p> <p>Your application
      retrieves configuration data by first establishing a configuration session
      using the AppConfig Data <a>StartConfigurationSession</a> API action. Your
      session's client then makes periodic calls to
      <a>GetLatestConfiguration</a> to check for and retrieve the latest data
      available.</p> <p>When calling <code>StartConfigurationSession</code>,
      your code sends the following information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Identifiers
      (ID or name) of an AppConfig application, environment, and configuration
      profile that the session tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) The minimum
      amount of time the session's client must wait between calls to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In response,
      AppConfig provides an <code>InitialConfigurationToken</code> to be given
      to the session's client and used the first time it calls
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> for that session.</p> <important>
      <p>This token should only be used once in your first call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>. You <i>must</i> use the new token in
      the <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> response
      (<code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code>) in each subsequent call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </important> <p>When calling
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>, your client code sends the most
      recent <code>ConfigurationToken</code> value it has and receives in
      response:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code>: the
      <code>ConfigurationToken</code> value to use on the next call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>NextPollIntervalInSeconds</code>: the duration the client should
      wait before making its next call to <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.
      This duration may vary over the course of the session, so it should be
      used instead of the value sent on the
      <code>StartConfigurationSession</code> call.</p> </li> <li> <p>The
      configuration: the latest data intended for the session. This may be empty
      if the client already has the latest version of the configuration.</p>
      </li> </ul> <important> <p>The <code>InitialConfigurationToken</code> and
      <code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code> should only be used once. To
      support long poll use cases, the tokens are valid for up to 24 hours. If a
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> call uses an expired token, the system
      returns <code>BadRequestException</code>.</p> </important> <p>For more
      information and to view example CLI commands that show how to retrieve a
      configuration using the AppConfig Data
      <code>StartConfigurationSession</code> and

                  of the active runs for a flow, or you can cancel specific runs
                  by providing their IDs.</p> <p>You can cancel a flow run only
                  when the run is in progress. You can't cancel a run that has
                  already completed or failed. You also can't cancel a run
                  that's scheduled to occur but hasn't started yet. To prevent a
                  scheduled run, you can deactivate the flow with the
                  <code>StopFlow</code> action.</p> <p>You cannot resume a run
                  after you cancel it.</p> <p>When you send your request, the
                  status for each run becomes <code>CancelStarted</code>. When
                  the cancellation completes, the status becomes
                  <code>Canceled</code>.</p> <note> <p>When you cancel a run,
                  you still incur charges for any data that the run already
                  processed before the cancellation. If the run had already
                  written some data to the flow destination, then that data
                  remains in the destination. If you configured the flow to use
                  a batch API (such as the Salesforce Bulk API 2.0), then the
                  run will finish reading or writing its entire batch of data
                  after the cancellation. For these operations, the data
                  processing charges for Amazon AppFlow apply. For the pricing

      CloudWatch Application Insights is a service that helps you detect common
      problems with your applications. It enables you to pinpoint the source of
      issues in your applications (built with technologies such as Microsoft
      IIS, .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key insights into
      detected problems.</p> <p>After you onboard your application, CloudWatch
      Application Insights identifies, recommends, and sets up metrics and logs.
      It continuously analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for unusual
      behavior to surface actionable problems with your application. For
      example, if your application is slow and unresponsive and leading to HTTP
      500 errors in your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights
      informs you that a memory pressure problem with your SQL Server database
      is occurring. It bases this analysis on impactful metrics and log errors.

      <p>AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it
      easy to monitor and
               control containerized microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your microservices
               communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high-availability for
               your applications.</p>
               <p>App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every
               microservice in an application. You can use App Mesh with Amazon ECS
               (using the Amazon EC2 launch type), Amazon EKS, and Kubernetes on AWS.</p>
               <note>
                  <p>App Mesh supports containerized microservice applications that use service discovery
                  naming for their components. To use App Mesh, you must have a containerized application
                  running on Amazon EC2 instances, hosted in either Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, or Kubernetes on AWS. For
                  more information about service discovery on Amazon ECS, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Service Discovery</a> in the
                     <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. Kubernetes <code>kube-dns</code> is supported.
                  For more information, see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/">DNS
                     for Services and Pods</a> in the Kubernetes documentation.</p>

                description: >-
                  <p> <b>We strongly recommend that all Auto Scaling groups use
                  launch templates to ensure full functionality for Amazon EC2
                  Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2.</b> </p> <p>Updates the
                  configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>To
                  update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group
                  and the property that you want to change. Any properties that
                  you don't specify are not changed by this update request. The
                  new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this
                  call returns. </p> <p>If you associate a new launch
                  configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new
                  instances will get the updated configuration. Existing
                  instances continue to run with the configuration that they
                  were originally launched with. When you update a group to
                  specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch
                  configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced
                  to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the
                  policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand
                  capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this
                  means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated
                  and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances,
                  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before
                  terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not
                  compromise the performance or availability of your
                  application.</p> <p>Note the following about changing
                  <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, <code>MaxSize</code>, or
                  <code>MinSize</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If a scale-in activity
                  occurs as a result of a new <code>DesiredCapacity</code> value
                  that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto
                  Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which
                  instances to terminate.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you specify a new
                  value for <code>MinSize</code> without specifying a value for
                  <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, and the new <code>MinSize</code>
                  is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the
                  group's <code>DesiredCapacity</code> to the new
                  <code>MinSize</code> value.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you specify a
                  new value for <code>MaxSize</code> without specifying a value
                  for <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, and the new
                  <code>MaxSize</code> is smaller than the current size of the
                  group, this sets the group's <code>DesiredCapacity</code> to
                  the new <code>MaxSize</code> value.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To see
                  which properties have been set, call the
                  <a>DescribeAutoScalingGroups</a> API. To view the scaling
                  policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the
                  <a>DescribePolicies</a> API. If the group has scaling

      <p>Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for
      developers who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API
      operations, data types, and errors. </p> <p>Audit Manager is a service
      that provides automated evidence collection so that you can continually
      audit your Amazon Web Services usage. You can use it to assess the
      effectiveness of your controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance.</p>
      <p>Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate
      assessments for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt
      collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These
      controls are grouped according to the requirements of the specified
      compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and
      controls to support internal audits with specific requirements. </p>

                  <p>Deletes an assessment report in Audit Manager. </p> <p>When
                  you run the <code>DeleteAssessmentReport</code> operation,
                  Audit Manager attempts to delete the following data:</p> <ol>
                  <li> <p>The specified assessment report that’s stored in your
                  S3 bucket</p> </li> <li> <p>The associated metadata that’s
                  stored in Audit Manager</p> </li> </ol> <p>If Audit Manager
                  can’t access the assessment report in your S3 bucket, the
                  report isn’t deleted. In this event, the
                  <code>DeleteAssessmentReport</code> operation doesn’t fail.
                  Instead, it proceeds to delete the associated metadata only.
                  You must then delete the assessment report from the S3 bucket
                  yourself. </p> <p>This scenario happens when Audit Manager
                  receives a <code>403 (Forbidden)</code> or <code>404 (Not
                  Found)</code> error from Amazon S3. To avoid this, make sure
                  that your S3 bucket is available, and that you configured the
                  correct permissions for Audit Manager to delete resources in
                  your S3 bucket. For an example permissions policy that you can
                  use, see <a

                  <p>Removes the specified Amazon Web Services account as a
                  delegated administrator for Audit Manager. </p> <p>When you
                  remove a delegated administrator from your Audit Manager
                  settings, you continue to have access to the evidence that you
                  previously collected under that account. This is also the case
                  when you deregister a delegated administrator from
                  Organizations. However, Audit Manager stops collecting and
                  attaching evidence to that delegated administrator account
                  moving forward.</p> <important> <p>Keep in mind the following
                  cleanup task if you use evidence finder:</p> <p>Before you use
                  your management account to remove a delegated administrator,
                  make sure that the current delegated administrator account
                  signs in to Audit Manager and disables evidence finder first.
                  Disabling evidence finder automatically deletes the event data
                  store that was created in their account when they enabled
                  evidence finder. If this task isn’t completed, the event data
                  store remains in their account. In this case, we recommend
                  that the original delegated administrator goes to CloudTrail
                  Lake and manually <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-eds-disable-termination.html">deletes
                  the event data store</a>.</p> <p>This cleanup task is
                  necessary to ensure that you don't end up with multiple event
                  data stores. Audit Manager ignores an unused event data store
                  after you remove or change a delegated administrator account.
                  However, the unused event data store continues to incur
                  storage costs from CloudTrail Lake if you don't delete it.</p>
                  </important> <p>When you deregister a delegated administrator
                  account for Audit Manager, the data for that account isn’t
                  deleted. If you want to delete resource data for a delegated
                  administrator account, you must perform that task separately
                  before you deregister the account. Either, you can do this in
                  the Audit Manager console. Or, you can use one of the delete
                  API operations that are provided by Audit Manager. </p> <p>To
                  delete your Audit Manager resource data, see the following

      <p>Welcome to the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53
      Application Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC).</p> <p>You can start a
      zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an
      Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from an
      impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your
      application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web
      Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.</p> <p>You
      can also configure zonal autoshift for a load balancer resource. Zonal
      autoshift is a capability in Route 53 ARC where Amazon Web Services shifts
      away application resource traffic from an Availability Zone, on your
      behalf, to help reduce your time to recovery during events. Amazon Web
      Services shifts away traffic for resources that are enabled for zonal
      autoshift whenever Amazon Web Services determines that there's an issue in
      the Availability Zone that could potentially affect customers.</p> <p>To
      ensure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application, you must also
      configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a resource.
      Practice runs start weekly zonal shifts for a resource, to shift traffic
      for the resource out of an Availability Zone. Practice runs make sure, on
      a regular basis, that you have enough capacity in all the Availability
      Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region for your application to continue to
      operate normally when traffic for a resource is shifted away from one
      Availability Zone.</p> <important> <p>You must prescale resource capacity
      in all Availability Zones in the Region where your application is
      deployed, before you configure practice runs or enable zonal autoshift for
      a resource. You should not rely on scaling on demand when an autoshift or
      practice run starts. </p> </important> <p>For more information about using
      zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html">Amazon

      <fullname>Batch</fullname> <p>Using Batch, you can run batch computing
      workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common
      means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of
      compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to
      remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing
      required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch
      computing software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision
      resources d, and work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing
      your overall compute costs, and delivering results more quickly.</p> <p>As
      a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any
      scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes
      workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
      workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch
      computing software. This means that you can focus on analyzing results and
      solving your specific problems instead.</p>

                  <p>Creates an Batch compute environment. You can create
                  <code>MANAGED</code> or <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute
                  environments. <code>MANAGED</code> compute environments can
                  use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. <code>UNMANAGED</code>
                  compute environments can only use EC2 resources.</p> <p>In a
                  managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and
                  instance types of the compute resources within the
                  environment. This is based on the compute resource
                  specification that you define or the <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">launch
                  template</a> that you specify when you create the compute
                  environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand
                  Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and
                  Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You
                  can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only
                  launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified
                  percentage of the On-Demand price.</p> <note> <p>Multi-node
                  parallel jobs aren't supported on Spot Instances.</p> </note>
                  <p>In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your
                  own EC2 compute resources and have flexibility with how you
                  configure your compute resources. For example, you can use
                  custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs
                  meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For
                  more information, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html">container
                  instance AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service
                  Developer Guide</i>. After you created your unmanaged compute
                  environment, you can use the
                  <a>DescribeComputeEnvironments</a> operation to find the
                  Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, launch
                  your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For
                  more information, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html">Launching

                  a compute environment that uses EKS resources, the caller must
                  have permissions to call <code>eks:DescribeCluster</code>.</p>
                  </note> <note> <p>Batch doesn't automatically upgrade the AMIs
                  in a compute environment after it's created. For example, it
                  also doesn't update the AMIs in your compute environment when
                  a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available.
                  You're responsible for the management of the guest operating
                  system. This includes any updates and security patches. You're
                  also responsible for any additional application software or
                  utilities that you install on the compute resources. There are
                  two ways to use a new AMI for your Batch jobs. The original
                  method is to complete these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a
                  new compute environment with the new AMI.</p> </li> <li>
                  <p>Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.</p>
                  </li> <li> <p>Remove the earlier compute environment from your
                  job queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete the earlier compute
                  environment.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In April 2022, Batch added
                  enhanced support for updating compute environments. For more
                  information, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html">Updating
                  compute environments</a>. To use the enhanced updating of
                  compute environments to update AMIs, follow these rules:</p>
                  <ul> <li> <p>Either don't set the service role
                  (<code>serviceRole</code>) parameter or set it to the
                  <b>AWSBatchServiceRole</b> service-linked role.</p> </li> <li>
                  <p>Set the allocation strategy
                  (<code>allocationStrategy</code>) parameter to
                  <code>BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE</code>,
                  <code>SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED</code>, or
                  <code>SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED</code>.</p> </li> <li>
                  <p>Set the update to latest image version
                  (<code>updateToLatestImageVersion</code>) parameter to
                  <code>true</code>. The <code>updateToLatestImageVersion</code>
                  parameter is used when you update a compute environment. This
                  parameter is ignored when you create a compute
                  environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't specify an AMI ID in
                  <code>imageId</code>, <code>imageIdOverride</code> (in <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_Ec2Configuration.html">
                  <code>ec2Configuration</code> </a>), or in the launch template
                  (<code>launchTemplate</code>). In that case, Batch selects the
                  latest Amazon ECS optimized AMI that's supported by Batch at
                  the time the infrastructure update is initiated.
                  Alternatively, you can specify the AMI ID in the
                  <code>imageId</code> or <code>imageIdOverride</code>
                  parameters, or the launch template identified by the
                  <code>LaunchTemplate</code> properties. Changing any of these
                  properties starts an infrastructure update. If the AMI ID is
                  specified in the launch template, it can't be replaced by
                  specifying an AMI ID in either the <code>imageId</code> or
                  <code>imageIdOverride</code> parameters. It can only be
                  replaced by specifying a different launch template, or if the
                  launch template version is set to <code>$Default</code> or
                  <code>$Latest</code>, by setting either a new default version
                  for the launch template (if <code>$Default</code>) or by
                  adding a new version to the launch template (if
                  <code>$Latest</code>).</p> </li> </ul> <p>If these rules are
                  followed, any update that starts an infrastructure update
                  causes the AMI ID to be re-selected. If the
                  <code>version</code> setting in the launch template
                  (<code>launchTemplate</code>) is set to <code>$Latest</code>
                  or <code>$Default</code>, the latest or default version of the
                  launch template is evaluated up at the time of the
                  infrastructure update, even if the <code>launchTemplate</code>
                  wasn't updated.</p> </note>

      <p>Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that

      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/understanding-eb.html#eb-other-definitions">proforma</a>
      version of your billing data each month, to accurately show or chargeback
      your end customers. Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't change
      the way you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design.
      Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to configure, generate, and
      display rates to certain customers over a given billing period. You can
      also analyze the difference between the rates you apply to your accounting
      groupings relative to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a
      result of your Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor configuration, the
      payer account can also see the custom rate applied on the billing details
      page of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing">Amazon Web
      Services Billing console</a>, or configure a cost and usage report per
      billing group.</p> <p>This documentation shows how you can configure
      Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor using its API. For more information

      types for the Amazon Web Services Budgets feature. </p> <p>Budgets provide
      you with a way to see the following information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>How
      close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits</p>
      </li> <li> <p>Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your

      charges by the end of the month</p> </li> <li> <p>How much of your budget

      spend on a service.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Usage budgets</b> - Plan how
      much you want to use one or more services.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>RI
      utilization budgets</b> - Define a utilization threshold, and receive
      alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you see if
      your RIs are unused or under-utilized.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>RI coverage
      budgets</b> - Define a coverage threshold, and receive alerts when the
      number of your instance hours that are covered by RIs fall below that
      threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by
      a reservation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Service Endpoint</p> <p>The Amazon Web

      <p>Welcome to the <i>Clean Rooms API Reference</i>.</p> <p>Clean Rooms is
      an Amazon Web Services service that helps multiple parties to join their
      data together in a secure collaboration workspace. In the collaboration,
      members who can query and receive results can get insights into the
      collective datasets without either party getting access to the other
      party's raw data.</p> <p>To learn more about Clean Rooms concepts,
      procedures, and best practices, see the <a

                  <note> <p>For backwards compatibility with older versions of
                  BraketSchemas, OpenQASM information is omitted from GetDevice
                  API calls. To get this information the user-agent needs to
                  present a recent version of the BraketSchemas (1.8.0 or
                  later). The Braket SDK automatically reports this for you. If
                  you do not see OpenQASM results in the GetDevice response when
                  using a Braket SDK, you may need to set AWS_EXECUTION_ENV
                  environment variable to configure user-agent. See the code
                  examples provided below for how to do this for the AWS CLI,
                  Boto3, and the Go, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs.</p>

      <fullname>CloudFormation</fullname> <p>CloudFormation allows you to create
      and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and
      repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage Amazon Web Services
      products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block
      Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and
      Auto Scaling to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective
      applications without creating or configuring the underlying Amazon Web
      Services infrastructure.</p> <p>With CloudFormation, you declare all your
      resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a
      collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. CloudFormation
      creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages
      all dependencies between the resources for you.</p> <p>For more
      information about CloudFormation, see the <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation product
      page</a>.</p> <p>CloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services
      products. If you need additional technical information about a specific
      Amazon Web Services product, you can find the product's technical
      documentation at <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/">docs.aws.amazon.com</a>.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the <i>Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML API
      Reference</i>.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML provides a
      privacy-enhancing method for two parties to identify similar users in
      their data without the need to share their data with each other. The first
      party brings the training data to Clean Rooms so that they can create and
      configure an audience model (lookalike model) and associate it with a
      collaboration. The second party then brings their seed data to Clean Rooms
      and generates an audience (lookalike segment) that resembles the training
      data.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML
      concepts, procedures, and best practices, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/machine-learning.html">Clean

                  <p>Posts a batch of documents to a search domain for indexing.
                  A document batch is a collection of add and delete operations
                  that represent the documents you want to add, update, or
                  delete from your domain. Batches can be described in either
                  JSON or XML. Each item that you want Amazon CloudSearch to
                  return as a search result (such as a product) is represented
                  as a document. Every document has a unique ID and one or more
                  fields that contain the data that you want to search and
                  return in results. Individual documents cannot contain more
                  than 1 MB of data. The entire batch cannot exceed 5 MB. To get
                  the best possible upload performance, group add and delete
                  operations in batches that are close the 5 MB limit.
                  Submitting a large volume of single-document batches can
                  overload a domain's document service. </p> <p>The endpoint for
                  submitting <code>UploadDocuments</code> requests is
                  domain-specific. To get the document endpoint for your domain,
                  use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service

      <fullname>CodeBuild</fullname> <p>CodeBuild is a fully managed build
      service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit
      tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild
      eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build
      servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular
      programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and
      more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild to use
      your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build
      requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more

      <p> CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with
      language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache
      Maven, pip, and dotnet. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with
      development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both
      public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream
      relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository,
      which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a
      package manager client. </p> <p> <b>CodeArtifact Components</b> </p>
      <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following
      CodeArtifact components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Repository</b>: A
      CodeArtifact repository contains a set of <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/welcome.html#welcome-concepts-package-version">package
      versions</a>, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files.
      Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of
      any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and
      publishing packages using tools like the <b> <code>npm</code> </b> CLI,
      the Maven CLI (<b> <code>mvn</code> </b>), Python CLIs (<b>
      <code>pip</code> </b> and <code>twine</code>), and NuGet CLIs
      (<code>nuget</code> and <code>dotnet</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Domain</b>: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity
      known as a <i>domain</i>. All package assets and metadata are stored in
      the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset,
      such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many
      repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain
      are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in Key
      Management Service (KMS).</p> <p>Each repository is a member of a single
      domain and can't be moved to a different domain.</p> <p>The domain allows
      organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as
      which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public
      repositories can be used as sources of packages.</p> <p>Although an
      organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production
      domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and
      share packages across their organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Package</b>: A <i>package</i> is a bundle of software and the metadata
      required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact
      supports <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-npm.html">npm</a>,
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-python.html">PyPI</a>,
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-maven">Maven</a>,
      and <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-nuget">NuGet</a>
      package formats.</p> <p>In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p>A <i>name</i> (for example, <code>webpack</code> is the name of a
      popular npm package)</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional namespace (for example,
      <code>@types</code> in <code>@types/node</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p>A set
      of versions (for example, <code>1.0.0</code>, <code>1.0.1</code>,
      <code>1.0.2</code>, etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p> Package-level metadata (for
      example, npm tags)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package version</b>:
      A version of a package, such as <code>@types/node 12.6.9</code>. The
      version number format and semantics vary for different package formats.
      For example, npm package versions must conform to the <a
      href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning specification</a>. In
      CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier,
      metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Upstream repository</b>: One repository is <i>upstream</i> of
      another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the
      repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the
      contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client.
      CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two
      repositories.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Asset</b>: An individual file stored
      in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm
      <code>.tgz</code> file or Maven POM and JAR files.</p> </li> </ul>
      <p>CodeArtifact supports these operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <code>AssociateExternalConnection</code>: Adds an existing external
      connection to a repository. </p> </li> <li> <p>

                  authorization tokens are valid for a period of 12 hours when
                  created with the <code>login</code> command. You can call
                  <code>login</code> periodically to refresh the token. When you
                  create an authorization token with the
                  <code>GetAuthorizationToken</code> API, you can set a custom
                  authorization period, up to a maximum of 12 hours, with the

                  <code>login</code> or <code>GetAuthorizationToken</code> is
                  called while assuming a role, the token lifetime is
                  independent of the maximum session duration of the role. For
                  example, if you call <code>sts assume-role</code> and specify
                  a session duration of 15 minutes, then generate a CodeArtifact
                  authorization token, the token will be valid for the full

                  15-minute session duration.</p> <p>See <a

      <fullname>CloudTrail</fullname> <p>This is the CloudTrail API Reference.
      It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and
      common errors for CloudTrail.</p> <p>CloudTrail is a web service that
      records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account
      and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information
      includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web
      Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the
      response elements returned by the service.</p> <note> <p>As an alternative
      to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist
      of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and
      platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide
      programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle
      cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests
      automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs,
      including how to download and install them, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools to Build on Amazon Web
      Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>See the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html">CloudTrail
      User Guide</a> for information about the data that is included with each

    description: >-
      <p>CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application
      deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your
      own facility, serverless Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon
      ECS service.</p> <p>You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of
      application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated
      applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files,
      executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. CodeDeploy
      can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub
      repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes
      to your existing code before you can use CodeDeploy.</p> <p>CodeDeploy
      makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid
      downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of
      updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with
      error-prone manual deployments.</p> <p> <b>CodeDeploy Components</b> </p>
      <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following
      CodeDeploy components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Application</b>: A name that
      uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. CodeDeploy uses
      this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct
      combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group
      are referenced during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment
      group</b>: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment
      configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A
      Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of
      a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service
      created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to
      reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An
      Amazon EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged
      instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or
      both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and
      rollback settings.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A
      set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used
      by CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment</b>:
      The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a
      containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing
      content on one or more instances. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application
      revisions</b>: For an Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that
      specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to
      validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this
      is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition,
      container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an
      EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source
      content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment
      scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3
      buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely
      identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For
      GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>This guide also contains information to help you get details
      about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances
      available for CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda
      function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service
      deployments.</p> <p> <b>CodeDeploy Information Resources</b> </p> <ul>

      performance data from your live applications, and provides recommendations
      that can help you fine-tune your application performance. Using machine
      learning algorithms, CodeGuru Profiler can help you find your most
      expensive lines of code and suggest ways you can improve efficiency and
      remove CPU bottlenecks. </p> <p> Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides
      different visualizations of profiling data to help you identify what code
      is running on the CPU, see how much time is consumed, and suggest ways to
      reduce CPU utilization. </p> <note> <p>Amazon CodeGuru Profiler currently
      supports applications written in all Java virtual machine (JVM) languages
      and Python. While CodeGuru Profiler supports both visualizations and

                  &lt;code&gt;period&lt;/code&gt;, the latest aggregated profile
                  is returned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Aggregated profiles are
                  available with aggregation periods of 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 1
                  day, aligned to UTC. The aggregation period of an aggregated
                  profile determines how long it is retained. For more
                  information, see &lt;a
                  href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_AggregatedProfileTime.html&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;code&gt;AggregatedProfileTime&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/a&gt;. The
                  aggregated profile's aggregation period determines how long it
                  is retained by CodeGuru Profiler. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If the aggregation period is 5 minutes,
                  the aggregated profile is retained for 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If the aggregation period is
                  1 hour, the aggregated profile is retained for 60 days.
                  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If the aggregation
                  period is 1 day, the aggregated profile is retained for 3
                  years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are
                  two use cases for calling
                  &lt;code&gt;GetProfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to return an aggregated
                  profile that already exists, use &lt;a
                  href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_ListProfileTimes.html&quot;&gt;
                  &lt;code&gt;ListProfileTimes&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/a&gt; to view
                  the time ranges of existing aggregated profiles. Use them in a
                  &lt;code&gt;GetProfile&lt;/code&gt; request to return a
                  specific, existing aggregated profile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to return an aggregated
                  profile for a time range that doesn't align with an existing
                  aggregated profile, then CodeGuru Profiler makes a best effort
                  to combine existing aggregated profiles from the requested
                  time range and return them as one aggregated profile.
                  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If aggregated profiles do not exist for
                  the full time range requested, then aggregated profiles for a
                  smaller time range are returned. For example, if the requested
                  time range is from 00:00 to 00:20, and the existing aggregated
                  profiles are from 00:15 and 00:25, then the aggregated
                  profiles from 00:15 to 00:20 are returned. &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; </code></pre>

      <fullname>CodePipeline</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is the
      CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the
      actions and data types for CodePipeline. Some functionality for your
      pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodePipeline
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can use the CodePipeline API to work with
      pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions.</p> <p> <i>Pipelines</i> are
      models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named,
      and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. </p> <p>You can work
      with pipelines by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which
      creates a uniquely named pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified pipeline.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline
      structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource
      Name (ARN).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineExecution</a>, which returns
      information about a specific execution of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current state
      of the stages and actions of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListActionExecutions</a>, which returns action-level details for past
      executions. The details include full stage and action-level details,
      including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred
      during the execution, and input and output artifact location details.</p>
      </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the
      pipelines associated with your account.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListPipelineExecutions</a>, which gets a summary of the most recent
      executions for a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the most recent revision of an
      artifact through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>StopPipelineExecution</a>, which stops the specified pipeline execution
      from continuing through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to
      the structure of the pipeline.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pipelines include
      <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete
      before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a
      stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until
      either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a
      user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline.
      You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a
      pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or
      <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline,
      including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the
      structure of stages and actions, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html">CodePipeline
      Pipeline Structure Reference</a>.</p> <p>Pipeline stages include
      <i>actions</i> that are categorized into categories such as source or
      build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use
      a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as
      Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most
      cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with
      pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and
      <a>GetPipelineState</a>. Valid action categories are:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>Source</p> </li> <li> <p>Build</p> </li> <li> <p>Test</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Deploy</p> </li> <li> <p>Approval</p> </li> <li> <p>Invoke</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the
      transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the
      actions in one stage complete.</p> <p>You can work with transitions by
      calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents
      artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of
      artifacts between stages in a pipeline. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Using the
      API to integrate with CodePipeline</b> </p> <p>For third-party integrators
      or developers who want to create their own integrations with CodePipeline,
      the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with
      CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:</p> <p>
      <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a
      source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. </p>
      <p>You can work with jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received
      the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns
      the details of a job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForJobs</a>, which
      determines whether there are any jobs to act on.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure. </p>
      </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job
      success.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances
      of an action created by a partner action and integrated into CodePipeline.

      <fullname>AWS CodeStar Connections</fullname> <p>This Amazon Web Services
      CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and usage
      examples of the operations and data types for the Amazon Web Services
      CodeStar Connections API. You can use the connections API to work with
      connections and installations.</p> <p> <i>Connections</i> are
      configurations that you use to connect Amazon Web Services resources to
      external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be
      given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party
      repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in
      CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is made
      to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and
      associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection.</p>
      <p>When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party
      connection handshake. <i>Installations</i> are the apps that are used to
      conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket
      provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a connection, you can
      choose an existing installation or create one.</p> <p>When you want to
      create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub
      Enterprise Server, you create a <i>host</i> for your connections.</p>
      <p>You can work with connections by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>CreateConnection</a>, which creates a uniquely named connection that
      can be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeleteConnection</a>, which deletes the specified connection.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>GetConnection</a>, which returns information about the
      connection, including the connection status.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListConnections</a>, which lists the connections associated with your
      account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can work with hosts by calling:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p> <a>CreateHost</a>, which creates a host that represents the
      infrastructure where your provider is installed.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeleteHost</a>, which deletes the specified host.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>GetHost</a>, which returns information about the host, including the
      setup status.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListHosts</a>, which lists the hosts
      associated with your account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can work with tags in
      Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections by calling the following:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p> <a>ListTagsForResource</a>, which gets information about
      Amazon Web Services tags for a specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in
      Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>TagResource</a>, which adds or updates tags for a resource in Amazon
      Web Services CodeStar Connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>UntagResource</a>, which removes tags for a resource in Amazon Web
      Services CodeStar Connections.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about
      how to use Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections, see the <a

      <fullname>Amazon Cognito Sync</fullname> <p>Amazon Cognito Sync provides
      an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of
      application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available
      for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to persist data
      locally so that it's available even if the device is offline. Developer
      credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device to access the
      service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
      credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB
      of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user
      identity.</p> <p>With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each
      identity is accessible only to credentials assigned to that identity. In
      order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need to make API calls using
      credentials retrieved with <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon
      Cognito Identity service</a>.</p> <p>If you want to use Cognito Sync in an
      Android or iOS application, you will probably want to make API calls via
      the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer
      Guide for Android</a> and the <a

                  Identity Pool to the configured stream. Customers are limited
                  to one successful bulk publish per 24 hours. Bulk publish is
                  an asynchronous request, customers can see the status of the

                  ResourceConflictException if you try to patch a record with a
                  new value but a stale sync count.</p><p>For example, if the

                  you try and submit a new highScore with sync count of 4, the
                  request will be rejected. To obtain the current sync count for
                  a record, call ListRecords. On a successful update of the

                  record. You should present that sync count the next time you

      Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary
      credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It
      uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent
      identity over the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>Using Amazon Cognito
      Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more
      third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or
      an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
      unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier
      for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security
      Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
      credentials.</p> <p>For a description of the authentication flow from the
      Amazon Cognito Developer Guide see <a

                  and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At
                  that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers

                  used to change a customer's position in the queue. For

                  setting a lower routing priority relative to other contacts in
                  queue; or you can move a contact to the front of the queue by
                  increasing the routing age which will make the contact look
                  artificially older and therefore higher up in the

      <fullname>Config</fullname> <p>Config provides a way to keep track of the
      configurations of all the Amazon Web Services resources associated with
      your Amazon Web Services account. You can use Config to get the current
      and historical configurations of each Amazon Web Services resource and
      also to get information about the relationship between the resources. An
      Amazon Web Services resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
      instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network
      Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of resources
      currently supported by Config, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported
      Amazon Web Services resources</a>.</p> <p>You can access and manage Config
      through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web
      Services Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), the Config API,
      or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference guide contains
      documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services CLI commands

      <p>Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
      utilization metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as
      Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions,
      Amazon EBS volumes, and Amazon ECS services on Fargate. It reports whether
      your resources are optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to
      reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. Compute
      Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data, in addition to
      projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you can
      use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance
      trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to
      move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and
      capacity requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer,
      including the required permissions to use the service, see the <a

      Tower supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records
      Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and
      delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected
      by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Amazon Web Services
      Control Tower service received, who made the request and when, and so on.
      For more about Amazon Web Services Control Tower and its support for
      CloudTrail, see <a

      <p>AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to
      exchange data in the cloud. You can use the AWS Data Exchange APIs to
      create, update, manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS
      Cloud.</p> <p>As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that
      you have an entitlement to through a subscription. You can use the APIs to
      download or copy your entitled data sets to Amazon Simple Storage Service
      (Amazon S3) for use across a variety of AWS analytics and machine learning
      services.</p> <p>As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets
      that you would like to publish to a product. Being able to package and
      provide your data sets into products requires a few steps to determine
      eligibility. For more information, visit the <i>AWS Data Exchange User
      Guide</i>.</p> <p>A data set is a collection of data that can be changed
      or updated over time. Data sets can be updated using revisions, which
      represent a new version or incremental change to a data set. A revision
      contains one or more assets. An asset in AWS Data Exchange is a piece of
      data that can be stored as an Amazon S3 object, Redshift datashare, API
      Gateway API, AWS Lake Formation data permission, or Amazon S3 data access.
      The asset can be a structured data file, an image file, or some other data
      file. Jobs are asynchronous import or export operations used to create or
      copy assets.</p>

      <p>AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called
      a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and
      ensuring that data dependencies are met so that your application can focus
      on processing the data.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR
      implementation of a task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS
      Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for common data management
      scenarios, such as performing database queries and running data analysis
      using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline
      Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own task runner to
      provide custom data management.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline implements two
      main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline and
      define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be
      performed on the data. Use the second set in your task runner application
      to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic for performing
      the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or converting
      the data from one format to another, is contained within the task runner.
      The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service,
      reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When the task is
      done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to
      the web service.</p>

      <p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to
      help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web
      Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts
      time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic
      from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs.
      It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.</p> <p>The
      Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior
      graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member
      accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.</p>
      <p>To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator
      account sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the
      invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.</p>
      <p>Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization
      management account designates the Detective administrator account for the
      organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the
      organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account is also
      the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations.</p>
      <p>The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account
      as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization
      accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account
      can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.</p>
      <p>Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API
      to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated
      with the currently selected endpoint.</p> <p>The administrator account for
      a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p>Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
      behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>View the list of member accounts in a
      behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add member accounts to a behavior
      graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>Apply tags to a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The
      organization management account can use the Detective API to select the
      delegated administrator for Detective.</p> <p>The Detective administrator
      account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the
      following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Perform all of the functions of an
      administrator account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine whether to
      automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts in the
      organization behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>An invited member account
      can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>View the
      list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accept
      an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decline
      an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove
      their account from a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All API actions
      are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging
      Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p> <note> <p>We replaced the
      term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An
      administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In
      the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in
      their behavior graph.</p> </note>

      recommendations, related events, and related metrics that can help you
      improve your operational applications. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html">What
      is Amazon DevOps Guru</a>. </p> <p> You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple
      Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight
      is created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in
      Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for each insight to help you manage
      and track your work addressing insights. </p> <p> To learn about the

      Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting
      data about your on-premises servers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agentless
      discovery</b> using Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service
      Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), which doesn't require you to
      install an agent on each host.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Agentless Collector
      gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which
      minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure
      assessment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Agentless Collector doesn't collect
      information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery
      collects that information. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Agent-based discovery</b> using the Amazon Web Services Application
      Discovery Agent (Application Discovery Agent) collects a richer set of
      data than agentless discovery, which you install on one or more hosts in
      your data center.</p> <ul> <li> <p> The agent captures infrastructure and
      application information, including an inventory of running processes,
      system performance information, resource utilization, and network
      dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p>The information collected by agents is
      secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service
      database in the Amazon Web Services cloud. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-agent.html">Amazon
      Web Services Application Discovery Agent</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
      <ul> <li> <p> <b>Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions</b>
      integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import
      details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services
      Migration Hub (Migration Hub) without using Agentless Collector or
      Application Discovery Agent.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Third-party application
      discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery
      Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database
      using the public API.</p> </li> <li> <p>In this way, you can import data
      into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications
      with servers and track migrations.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Working With This Guide</b> </p> <p>This API reference provides
      descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data
      types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows
      the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use
      one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to
      the programming language or platform that you're using. For more
      information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web
      Services SDKs</a>.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>Remember that you must set your
      Migration Hub home Region before you call any of these APIs.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
      associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home Region, or a
      <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is returned.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
      permitted outside of your home Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it is
      unlikely, the Migration Hub home Region could change. If you call APIs
      outside the home Region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code> is
      returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to
      obtain the latest Migration Hub home Region.</p> </li> </ul> </note>

      <p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to
      create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read
      data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between
      two snapshots. If you’re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers
      backup services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient
      and cost-effective to track incremental changes on your Amazon EBS volumes
      through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
      from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
      instances to compare the differences.</p> <p>You can create incremental
      snapshots directly from data on-premises into volumes and the cloud to use
      for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots,
      you can write your on-premises data to an snapshot during a disaster. Then
      after recovery, you can restore it back to Amazon Web Services or
      on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and maintain
      complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p> <p>This API
      reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
      parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about
      the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use
      them effectively, see <a

                  this one hour duration result in a
                  <code>ValidationException</code>. </p> <p>TTL compares the

                  TTL attribute of an item. If the epoch time value stored in

                  <important> <p>DynamoDB typically deletes expired items within
                  two days of expiration. The exact duration within which an
                  item gets deleted after expiration is specific to the nature
                  of the workload. Items that have expired and not been deleted
                  will still show up in reads, queries, and scans.</p>
                  </important> <p>As items are deleted, they are removed from
                  any local secondary index and global secondary index

      <p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service
      that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services
      without needing to setup or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane.
      Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment,
      scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p> <p>Amazon EKS
      runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you
      can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes
      community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with
      applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether
      running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you
      can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS
      without any code modification required.</p>

      Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container
      management service. It makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker
      containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure
      that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on
      Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon
      Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-premises) instances
      that you manage.</p> <p>Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop
      container-based applications with simple API calls. This makes it easy to
      get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you
      access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p> <p>You can use Amazon ECS
      to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your
      resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. With
      Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate your own cluster management and
      configuration management systems. You also don't need to worry about
      scaling your management infrastructure. </p>

      Elastic Container Registry Public (Amazon ECR Public) is a managed
      container image registry service. Amazon ECR provides both public and
      private registries to host your container images. You can use the Docker
      CLI or your preferred client to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR
      provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open
      Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports public repositories
      with this API. For information about the Amazon ECR API for private
      repositories, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon
      Elastic Container Registry API Reference</a>.</p>

                  Managing file system storage</a>.</p> <p>Each Amazon EFS file
                  system supports one lifecycle configuration, which applies to
                  all files in the file system. If a
                  <code>LifecycleConfiguration</code> object already exists for
                  the specified file system, a
                  <code>PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> call modifies the
                  existing configuration. A
                  <code>PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> call with an empty
                  <code>LifecyclePolicies</code> array in the request body
                  deletes any existing <code>LifecycleConfiguration</code>. In
                  the request, specify the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The ID
                  for the file system for which you are enabling, disabling, or
                  modifying Lifecycle management.</p> </li> <li> <p>A

                  files to IA storage, to Archive storage, and back to primary
                  storage.</p> <note> <p>Amazon EFS requires that each
                  <code>LifecyclePolicy</code> object have only have a single
                  transition, so the <code>LifecyclePolicies</code> array needs
                  to be structured with separate <code>LifecyclePolicy</code>
                  objects. See the example requests in the following section for
                  more information.</p> </note> </li> </ul> <p>This operation

                  <code>LifecycleConfiguration</code> object to an encrypted
                  file system, you need the same Key Management Service

      <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname> <p>A load balancer can
      distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances. This enables you to
      increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also
      monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes
      traffic only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to
      accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are
      configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to
      the load balancer and a protocol and port number for connections from the
      load balancer to the instances.</p> <p>Elastic Load Balancing supports
      three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load
      Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. You can select a load balancer
      based on your application needs. For more information, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic
      Load Balancing User Guide</a>.</p> <p>This reference covers the 2012-06-01
      API, which supports Classic Load Balancers. The 2015-12-01 API supports
      Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers.</p> <p>To get
      started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using
      <a>CreateLoadBalancer</a>. Register your instances with the load balancer
      using <a>RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer</a>.</p> <p>All Elastic Load
      Balancing operations are <i>idempotent</i>, which means that they complete
      at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds with a 200 OK
      response code.</p>

      <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname> <p>A load balancer distributes
      incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables
      you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer
      also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it
      routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer
      to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are
      configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to
      the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port
      number for connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with
      health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the
      targets.</p> <p>Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of
      load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers,
      Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers
      the following load balancer types:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Application Load
      Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports HTTP
      and HTTPS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network Load Balancer - Operates at the
      transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP, TLS, and UDP.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).</p>
      </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic
      Load Balancing User Guide</a>.</p> <p>All Elastic Load Balancing
      operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one
      time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds.</p>

      <p>Amazon EMR Serverless is a new deployment option for Amazon EMR. Amazon
      EMR Serverless provides a serverless runtime environment that simplifies
      running analytics applications using the latest open source frameworks
      such as Apache Spark and Apache Hive. With Amazon EMR Serverless, you
      don’t have to configure, optimize, secure, or operate clusters to run
      applications with these frameworks.</p> <p>The API reference to Amazon EMR
      Serverless is <code>emr-serverless</code>. The <code>emr-serverless</code>
      prefix is used in the following scenarios: </p> <ul> <li> <p>It is the
      prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example,
      <code>aws emr-serverless start-job-run</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the
      prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example,
      <code>"Action": ["emr-serverless:StartJobRun"]</code>. For more
      information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions">Policy
      actions for Amazon EMR Serverless</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix
      used in Amazon EMR Serverless service endpoints. For example,
      <code>emr-serverless.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>.</p> </li> </ul>

      <p>Welcome to the <i>Entity Resolution API Reference</i>.</p> <p>Entity
      Resolution is an Amazon Web Services service that provides pre-configured
      entity resolution capabilities that enable developers and analysts at
      advertising and marketing companies to build an accurate and complete view
      of their consumers.</p> <p> With Entity Resolution, you can match source
      records containing consumer identifiers, such as name, email address, and
      phone number. This is true even when these records have incomplete or
      conflicting identifiers. For example, Entity Resolution can effectively
      match a source record from a customer relationship management (CRM) system
      with a source record from a marketing system containing campaign
      information.</p> <p>To learn more about Entity Resolution concepts,
      procedures, and best practices, see the <a

      <p>Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon
      Web Services resources. When your resources change state, they
      automatically send events to an event stream. You can create rules that
      match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take
      action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule.
      For example, you can configure rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically
      invoke an Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you
      that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data
      stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availability
      risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a
      snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information

                  stream.</p> <p>Use this operation to change the destination
                  type (for example, to replace the Amazon S3 destination with
                  Amazon Redshift) or change the parameters associated with a
                  destination (for example, to change the bucket name of the
                  Amazon S3 destination). The update might not occur
                  immediately. The target delivery stream remains active while
                  the configurations are updated, so data writes to the delivery
                  stream can continue during this process. The updated
                  configurations are usually effective within a few minutes.</p>
                  <p>Switching between Amazon OpenSearch Service and other
                  services is not supported. For an Amazon OpenSearch Service
                  destination, you can only update to another Amazon OpenSearch
                  Service destination.</p> <p>If the destination type is the
                  same, Kinesis Data Firehose merges the configuration
                  parameters specified with the destination configuration that
                  already exists on the delivery stream. If any of the
                  parameters are not specified in the call, the existing values
                  are retained. For example, in the Amazon S3 destination, if
                  <a>EncryptionConfiguration</a> is not specified, then the
                  existing <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code> is maintained on
                  the destination.</p> <p>If the destination type is not the
                  same, for example, changing the destination from Amazon S3 to
                  Amazon Redshift, Kinesis Data Firehose does not merge any
                  parameters. In this case, all parameters must be
                  specified.</p> <p>Kinesis Data Firehose uses
                  <code>CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId</code> to avoid race
                  conditions and conflicting merges. This is a required field,
                  and the service updates the configuration only if the existing
                  configuration has a version ID that matches. After the update
                  is applied successfully, the version ID is updated, and can be
                  retrieved using <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>. Use the new
                  version ID to set <code>CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId</code>

      <p>This is the Amazon Fraud Detector API Reference. This guide is for
      developers who need detailed information about Amazon Fraud Detector API
      actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Amazon Fraud
      Detector features, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/latest/ug/">Amazon Fraud
      Detector User Guide</a>.</p> <p>We provide the Query API as well as AWS
      software development kits (SDK) for Amazon Fraud Detector in Java and
      Python programming languages.</p> <p>The Amazon Fraud Detector Query API
      provides HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verb GET or POST and a Query
      parameter <code>Action</code>. AWS SDK provides libraries, sample code,
      tutorials, and other resources for software developers who prefer to build
      applications using language-specific APIs instead of submitting a request
      over HTTP or HTTPS. These libraries provide basic functions that
      automatically take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing your
      requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses, so that it is
      easier for you to get started. For more information about the AWS SDKs, go
      to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/">Tools to build on
      AWS</a> page, scroll down to the <b>SDK</b> section, and choose plus (+)
      sign to expand the section. </p>

      <fullname>Global Accelerator</fullname> <p>This is the <i>Global
      Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need
      detailed information about Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and
      errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global
      Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>Global Accelerator is a service in
      which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance of your
      applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of
      accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits. </p> <ul> <li>
      <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your
      internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard
      accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over
      the Amazon Web Services global network. </p> </li> <li> <p>For other
      scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom
      routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or
      more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p> </li> </ul>
      <important> <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports
      endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the
      US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with
      accelerators. That is, for example, specify <code>--region
      us-west-2</code> on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.</p> </important>
      <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses
      that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are
      anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global
      Accelerator provides two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global
      Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses
      and two static IPv6 addresses. With a standard accelerator for IPv4,
      instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can
      configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address
      ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP). </p> <p>For a
      standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across
      multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions ,
      which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for
      standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load
      Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located
      in one Amazon Web Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions.
      For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the
      static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are
      virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p> <important> <p>The static IP
      addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists,
      even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes
      traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the
      static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route
      traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions
      with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete
      an accelerator. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html">Tag-based
      policies</a>.</p> </important> <p>For standard accelerators, Global
      Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services global network to route traffic
      to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and
      policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in
      health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is
      always directed to healthy endpoints.</p> <p>For more information about
      understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global
      Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>

      <p> Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold data."</p>
      <p>Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure,
      durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With
      Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months,
      years, or decades. Glacier also enables customers to offload the
      administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they
      don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data
      replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware
      migrations.</p> <p>Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost
      is paramount and your data is rarely retrieved. If your application
      requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3.
      For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon
      Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>.</p> <p>You can store any kind of
      data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data
      you can store in Glacier.</p> <p>If you are a first-time user of Glacier,
      we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the
      <i>Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html">What
      is Amazon S3 Glacier</a> - This section of the Developer Guide describes
      the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs
      that you can use to interact with the service.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html">Getting
      Started with Amazon S3 Glacier</a> - The Getting Started section walks you
      through the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs
      to download archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting
      archives.</p> </li> </ul>

                  <p>This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload
                  archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in
                  parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart
                  upload.</p> <p>Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request
                  if any of the following conditions is true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
                  <b>SHA256 tree hash does not match</b>To ensure that part data
                  is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree
                  hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon
                  receiving the part data, Amazon S3 Glacier also computes a
                  SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't match, the
                  operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree
                  hash, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html">Computing
                  Checksums</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Part size does not
                  match</b>The size of each part except the last must match the
                  size specified in the corresponding
                  <a>InitiateMultipartUpload</a> request. The size of the last
                  part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified
                  size.</p> <note> <p>If you upload a part whose size is smaller
                  than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart
                  upload request and that part is not the last part, then the
                  upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent
                  Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.</p> </note> </li>
                  <li> <p> <b>Range does not align</b>The byte range value in
                  the request does not align with the part size specified in the
                  corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a
                  part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4
                  MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid
                  part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6
                  MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload
                  will fail. </p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation is idempotent.
                  If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included
                  in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded
                  data.</p> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all
                  operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access
                  Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default.
                  You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific

                  and their total size are as of the last inventory generation.
                  This means that if you add or remove an archive from a vault,
                  and then immediately use Describe Vault, the change in

                  <a>InitiateJob</a>. Amazon S3 Glacier generates vault
                  inventories approximately daily. For more information, see <a

                  the <code>Marker</code> field is set to a non-null value,
                  which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To
                  return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the
                  marker request parameter to the <code>Marker</code> value for
                  that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs
                  request.</p> <p>You can set a maximum limit for the number of
                  jobs returned in the response by specifying the
                  <code>limit</code> parameter in the request. The default limit
                  is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the
                  limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the
                  limit.</p> <p>Additionally, you can filter the jobs list
                  returned by specifying the optional <code>statuscode</code>
                  parameter or <code>completed</code> parameter, or both. Using
                  the <code>statuscode</code> parameter, you can specify to
                  return only jobs that match either the
                  <code>InProgress</code>, <code>Succeeded</code>, or
                  <code>Failed</code> status. Using the <code>completed</code>
                  parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were

                  are no more items the <code>marker</code> is
                  <code>null</code>. To return a list of multipart uploads that
                  begins at a specific upload, set the <code>marker</code>
                  request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous
                  List Multipart Upload request. You can also limit the number
                  of uploads returned in the response by specifying the
                  <code>limit</code> parameter in the request.</p> <p>Note the
                  difference between this operation and listing parts
                  (<a>ListParts</a>). The List Multipart Uploads operation lists
                  all multipart uploads for a vault and does not require a
                  multipart upload ID. The List Parts operation requires a
                  multipart upload ID since parts are associated with a single
                  upload.</p> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform

      collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react
      autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on
      local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon
      Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services
      Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda functions and components
      to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local

      <p>Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that
      analyzes and processes the following foundational data sources - VPC flow
      logs, Amazon Web Services CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3
      data event logs, EKS audit logs, DNS logs, Amazon EBS volume data, runtime
      activity belonging to container workloads, such as Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS
      (including Amazon Web Services Fargate), and Amazon EC2 instances. It uses
      threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IPs and domains, and
      machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and
      malicious activity within your Amazon Web Services environment. This can
      include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed
      credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, domains, or presence of
      malware on your Amazon EC2 instances and container workloads. For example,
      GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances and container workloads
      serving malware, or mining bitcoin. </p> <p>GuardDuty also monitors Amazon
      Web Services account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as
      unauthorized infrastructure deployments like EC2 instances deployed in a
      Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password
      policy change to reduce password strength. </p> <p>GuardDuty informs you
      about the status of your Amazon Web Services environment by producing
      security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through
      Amazon EventBridge. For more information, see the <i> <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html">Amazon
      GuardDuty User Guide</a> </i>. </p>

      <fullname>AWS Import/Export Service</fullname> AWS Import/Export
      accelerates transferring large amounts of data between the AWS cloud and
      portable storage devices that you mail to us. AWS Import/Export transfers
      data directly onto and off of your storage devices using Amazon's
      high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet. For large data
      sets, AWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more
      cost effective than upgrading your connectivity.

      <fullname>Health</fullname> <p>The Health API provides access to the
      Health information that appears in the <a
      href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home">Health Dashboard</a>. You
      can use the API operations to get information about events that might
      affect your Amazon Web Services and resources.</p> <p>You must have a
      Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services
      Support</a> to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an
      Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise
      On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a
      <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.</p> <p>For API access,
      you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use temporary
      credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible. Temporary
      credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security
      token that indicates when the credentials expire. For more information,
      see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html">Best
      practices for managing Amazon Web Services access keys</a> in the
      <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>You can use the
      Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call the Health
      API operations. Health supports a multi-Region application architecture
      and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. You can
      use the high availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon Web
      Services Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from
      the API. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html">Accessing
      the Health API</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For
      authentication of requests, Health uses the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
      Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <p>If your Amazon Web Services account
      is part of Organizations, you can use the Health organizational view
      feature. This feature provides a centralized view of Health events across
      all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate Health events in real
      time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an
      operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the
      organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return event
      information. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html">Aggregating
      Health events</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>When you
      use the Health API operations to return Health events, see the following
      recommendations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode">eventScopeCode</a>
      parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are public or
      account-specific.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use pagination to view all events from
      the response. For example, if you call the
      <code>DescribeEventsForOrganization</code> operation to get all events in
      your organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the
      <code>nextToken</code> in the next request to return more results.</p>
      </li> </ul> </note>

      <p>AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs —
      remote operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices
      connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a
      set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates,
      reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting
      operations.</p> <p> To create a job, you make a job document which is a
      description of the remote operations to be performed, and you specify a
      list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be
      individual things, thing groups or both.</p> <p> AWS IoT Jobs sends a
      message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts
      the execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the
      operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs
      service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific
      target and for all the targets of the job</p>

      <p>Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how
      internet issues impact the performance and availability between your
      applications hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users. It can
      reduce the time it takes for you to diagnose internet issues from days to
      minutes. Internet Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web
      Services captures from its global networking footprint to calculate a
      baseline of performance and availability for internet traffic. This is the
      same data that Amazon Web Services uses to monitor internet uptime and
      availability. With those measurements as a baseline, Internet Monitor
      raises awareness for you when there are significant problems for your end
      users in the different geographic locations where your application
      runs.</p> <p>Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to
      CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics, to easily support using CloudWatch
      tools with health information for geographies and networks specific to
      your application. Internet Monitor sends health events to Amazon
      EventBridge so that you can set up notifications. If an issue is caused by
      the Amazon Web Services network, you also automatically receive an Amazon
      Web Services Health Dashboard notification with the steps that Amazon Web
      Services is taking to mitigate the problem.</p> <p>To use Internet
      Monitor, you create a <i>monitor</i> and associate your application's
      resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces
      directories - so Internet Monitor can determine where your application's
      internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements
      from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the locations and ASNs
      (typically, internet service providers or ISPs) that communicate with your
      application.</p> <p>For more information, see <a

      <p>IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data,
      process messages, and store them. You can then query the data and run
      sophisticated analytics on it. IoT Analytics enables advanced data
      exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data
      visualization through integration with Amazon QuickSight.</p>
      <p>Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to
      process structured data. IoT data often comes from devices that record
      noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the
      data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and
      false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also,
      IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from
      external sources. </p> <p>IoT Analytics automates the steps required to
      analyze data from IoT devices. IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and
      enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for
      analysis. You can set up the service to collect only the data you need
      from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and
      enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and
      location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running
      queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex
      analytics and machine learning inference. IoT Analytics includes pre-built
      models for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which
      devices are about to fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning
      their wearable devices.</p>

      <p>Amazon Web Services IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully
      managed test capability for validating IoT devices during device software
      development. Device Advisor provides pre-built tests that you can use to
      validate IoT devices for reliable and secure connectivity with Amazon Web
      Services IoT Core before deploying devices to production. By using Device
      Advisor, you can confirm that your devices can connect to Amazon Web
      Services IoT Core, follow security best practices and, if applicable,
      receive software updates from IoT Device Management. You can also download
      signed qualification reports to submit to the Amazon Web Services Partner
      Network to get your device qualified for the Amazon Web Services Partner
      Device Catalog without the need to send your device in and wait for it to
      be tested.</p>

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)
      API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an Amazon Web
      Services EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both
      requests and responses, including errors.</p> <p>The API is an Amazon Web
      Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS
      HTTPS service endpoints, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS
      page</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <i>
      <b>All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. </b> </i> </p>
      <p>For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/doc-history.html">
      Document History</a>.</p> <p> <b>Allowed Header Values</b> </p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <code> <b>Accept:</b> </code> application/json</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code> <b>Accept-Encoding:</b> </code> gzip, deflate</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code> <b>Content-Type:</b> </code>application/json</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain information about
      your IVS live stream (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">
      Getting Started with Amazon IVS</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Channel</b> —
      Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a
      channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream.
      See the Channel endpoints for more information. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Stream key</b> — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a
      channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey
      endpoints for more information. <i> <b>Treat the stream key like a secret,
      since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.</b> </i> </p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Playback key pair</b> — Video playback may be restricted using
      playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback
      key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the
      playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Recording configuration</b> — Stores
      configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the
      recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording
      configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Playback restriction policy</b> —
      Restricts playback by countries and/or origin sites. See the Playback
      Restriction Policy endpoints for more information.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to
      an Amazon Web Services resource. A tag comprises a <i>key</i> and a
      <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as
      <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      Amazon Web Services Resources</a> for more information, including
      restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements";
      Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented
      there.</p> <p>Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web
      Services resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different
      resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to
      manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">
      Access Tags</a>). </p> <p>The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related
      endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and
      <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resources support tagging:
      Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording
      Configurations.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource. </p>
      <p> <b>Authentication versus Authorization</b> </p> <p>Note the
      differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. You need to be
      authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to
      have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition, authorization
      is needed to view <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html">Amazon
      IVS private channels</a>. (Private channels are channels that are enabled
      for "playback authorization.")</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Authentication</b>
      </p> <p>All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a
      signature. The Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon
      IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you.
      However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your
      responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You generate a signature using
      valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission to perform the
      requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a
      signature generated from a user account that has the
      <code>ivs:PutMetadata</code> permission.</p> <p>For more information:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
      Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
      Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS
      permissions — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User
      Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p>
      <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need
      to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM
      policies and API calls. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
      Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <b>Channel
      Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateChannel</a> — Creates a new

      processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified name or
      recording-configuration ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be
      used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409
      Conflict Exception).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateChannel</a> — Updates a
      channel's configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this
      channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take
      effect.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteChannel</a> — Deletes the specified
      channel.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Playback Restriction Policy Endpoints</b>
      </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreatePlaybackRestrictionPolicy</a> — Creates a new
      playback restriction policy, for constraining playback by countries and/or

      <p> <a>ImportPlaybackKeyPair</a> — Imports the public portion of a new key
      pair and returns its <code>arn</code> and <code>fingerprint</code>. The
      <code>privateKey</code> can then be used to generate viewer authorization
      tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels (channels enabled for
      playback authorization).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPlaybackKeyPair</a> —
      Gets a specified playback authorization key pair and returns the
      <code>arn</code> and <code>fingerprint</code>. The <code>privateKey</code>

                  Ensure that your S3 bucket is in the same region as the

                  Guide</i>.</p> <p>To identify an asset property, you must
                  specify one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The
                  <code>assetId</code> and <code>propertyId</code> of an asset
                  property.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <code>propertyAlias</code>,
                  which is a data stream alias (for example,
                  <code>/company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature</code>). To
                  define an asset property's alias, see <a

                  </li> </ul> <important> <p>With respect to Unix epoch time,
                  IoT SiteWise accepts only TQVs that have a timestamp of no
                  more than 7 days in the past and no more than 10 minutes in
                  the future. IoT SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the
                  inclusive range of [-7 days, +10 minutes] and returns a
                  <code>TimestampOutOfRangeException</code> error.</p> <p>For
                  each asset property, IoT SiteWise overwrites TQVs with
                  duplicate timestamps unless the newer TQV has a different
                  quality. For example, if you store a TQV <code>{T1, GOOD,
                  V1}</code>, then storing <code>{T1, GOOD, V2}</code> replaces
                  the existing TQV.</p> </important> <p>IoT SiteWise authorizes
                  access to each <code>BatchPutAssetPropertyValue</code> entry
                  individually. For more information, see <a

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)
      real-time API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an AWS
      EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and
      responses, including errors. </p> <p>Terminology:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A
      <i>stage</i> is a virtual space where participants can exchange video in
      real time.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <i>participant token</i> is a token that
      authenticates a participant when they join a stage.</p> </li> <li> <p>A
      <i>participant object</i> represents participants (people) in the stage
      and contains information about them. When a token is created, it includes
      a participant ID; when a participant uses that token to join a stage, the
      participant is associated with that participant ID. There is a 1:1 mapping
      between participant tokens and participants.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server-side
      composition: The <i>composition</i> process composites participants of a
      stage into a single video and forwards it to a set of outputs (e.g., IVS
      channels). Composition endpoints support this process.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Server-side composition: A <i>composition</i> controls the look of the
      outputs, including how participants are positioned in the video.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain
      information about your IVS live stream (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/RealTimeUserGuide/getting-started.html">Getting
      Started with Amazon IVS Real-Time Streaming</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Stage</b> — A stage is a virtual space where participants can exchange
      video in real time.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A
      <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag
      comprises a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example,
      you might set a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular
      video category. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      AWS Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply
      to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS stages has no
      service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags
      can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you
      can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are
      related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Access
      Tags</a>).</p> <p>The Amazon IVS real-time API has these tag-related
      endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and
      <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resource supports tagging:
      Stage.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.</p> <p>
      <b>Stages Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateParticipantToken</a> —

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API
      enables you to create and manage Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need
      to integrate with the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/chat-messaging-api.html">
      Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API</a>, to enable users to interact with chat
      rooms in real time.</p> <p>The API is an AWS regional service. For a list
      of supported regions and Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the
      Amazon IVS Chat information on the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS
      page</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. </p> <p> <b>Notes on
      terminology:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>You create service applications using
      the Amazon IVS Chat API. We refer to these as <i>applications</i>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>You create front-end client applications (browser and
      Android/iOS apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to
      these as <i>clients</i>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The
      following resources are part of Amazon IVS Chat:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>LoggingConfiguration</b> — A configuration that allows customers to
      store and record sent messages in a chat room. See the Logging
      Configuration endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Room</b> — The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients
      connect to and exchange chat messages. See the Room endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a
      metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a
      <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set
      a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category.
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      AWS Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply
      to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has no
      service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags
      can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you
      can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are
      related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Access
      Tags</a>).</p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat API has these tag-related endpoints:
      <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>.
      The following resource supports tagging: Room.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can
      be applied to a resource.</p> <p> <b>API Access Security</b> </p> <p>Your
      Amazon IVS Chat applications (service applications and clients) must be
      authenticated and authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the
      differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon
      IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to
      have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.</p> </li> </ul>
      <p>Users (viewers) connect to a room using secure access tokens that you
      create using the <a>CreateChatToken</a> endpoint through the AWS SDK. You
      call CreateChatToken for every user’s chat session, passing identity and
      authorization information about the user.</p> <p> <b>Signing API
      Requests</b> </p> <p>HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4
      signature using your AWS security credentials. The AWS Command Line
      Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API
      calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP
      API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You
      generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has
      permission to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage
      requests must be made using an IAM role that has the
      <code>ivschat:DeleteMessage</code> permission.</p> <p>For more
      information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures —
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
      Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
      Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS
      permissions — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User
      Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p>
      <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need
      to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM
      policies and API calls. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
      Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p>
      <b>Messaging Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DeleteMessage</a> — Sends
      an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific
      message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client’s
      chat history. This event’s <code>EventName</code> is
      <code>aws:DELETE_MESSAGE</code>. This replicates the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-deletemessage-publish.html">
      DeleteMessage</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging
      API.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DisconnectUser</a> — Disconnects all
      connections using a specified user ID from a room. This replicates the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-disconnectuser-publish.html">
      DisconnectUser</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging
      API.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>SendEvent</a> — Sends an event to a room. Use
      this within your application’s business logic to send events to clients of
      a room; e.g., to notify clients to change the way the chat UI is
      rendered.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Chat Token Endpoint</b> </p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <a>CreateChatToken</a> — Creates an encrypted token that is used by a
      chat participant to establish an individual WebSocket chat connection to a
      room. When the token is used to connect to chat, the connection is valid
      for the session duration specified in the request. The token becomes
      invalid at the token-expiration timestamp included in the response.</p>
      </li> </ul> <p> <b>Room Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateRoom</a>
      — Creates a room that allows clients to connect and pass messages.</p>
      </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteRoom</a> — Deletes the specified room.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>GetRoom</a> — Gets the specified room.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListRooms</a> — Gets summary information about all your rooms in the
      AWS region where the API request is processed. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>UpdateRoom</a> — Updates a room’s configuration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Logging Configuration Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>CreateLoggingConfiguration</a> — Creates a logging configuration that
      allows clients to store and record sent messages.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeleteLoggingConfiguration</a> — Deletes the specified logging
      configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetLoggingConfiguration</a> — Gets
      the specified logging configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListLoggingConfigurations</a> — Gets summary information about all your
      logging configurations in the AWS region where the API request is
      processed.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateLoggingConfiguration</a> — Updates
      a specified logging configuration.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tags
      Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ListTagsForResource</a> — Gets
      information about AWS tags for the specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>TagResource</a> — Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the
      specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UntagResource</a> — Removes tags from
      the resource with the specified ARN.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All the above are
      HTTP operations. There is a separate <i>messaging</i> API for managing
      Chat resources; see the <a

      <p>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly
      available, and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service.
      Amazon Keyspaces makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra
      workloads in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the
      Amazon Web Services Management Console or a few lines of code, you can
      create keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any
      infrastructure or installing software. </p> <p>In addition to supporting
      Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via open-source Cassandra drivers,
      Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition language (DDL) operations to
      manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, as
      well as infrastructure as code (IaC) services and tools such as
      CloudFormation and Terraform. This API reference describes the supported
      DDL operations in detail.</p> <p>For the list of all supported CQL APIs,
      see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/cassandra-apis.html">Supported
      Cassandra APIs, operations, and data types in Amazon Keyspaces</a> in the

      <p>AWS IoT Wireless provides bi-directional communication between
      internet-connected wireless devices and the AWS Cloud. To onboard both
      LoRaWAN and Sidewalk devices to AWS IoT, use the IoT Wireless API. These
      wireless devices use the Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN)
      communication protocol to communicate with AWS IoT.</p> <p>Using the API,
      you can perform create, read, update, and delete operations for your
      wireless devices, gateways, destinations, and profiles. After onboarding
      your devices, you can use the API operations to set log levels and monitor
      your devices with CloudWatch.</p> <p>You can also use the API operations
      to create multicast groups and schedule a multicast session for sending a
      downlink message to devices in the group. By using Firmware Updates
      Over-The-Air (FUOTA) API operations, you can create a FUOTA task and
      schedule a session to update the firmware of individual devices or an
      entire group of devices in a multicast group.</p>

                  <p> Use this API to retrieve media content from a Kinesis
                  video stream. In the request, you identify the stream name or
                  stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and the starting chunk.
                  Kinesis Video Streams then returns a stream of chunks in order
                  by fragment number.</p> <note> <p>You must first call the
                  <code>GetDataEndpoint</code> API to get an endpoint. Then send
                  the <code>GetMedia</code> requests to this endpoint using the
                  <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/">--endpoint-url
                  parameter</a>. </p> </note> <p>When you put media data
                  (fragments) on a stream, Kinesis Video Streams stores each
                  incoming fragment and related metadata in what is called a
                  "chunk." For more information, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_dataplane_PutMedia.html">PutMedia</a>.
                  The <code>GetMedia</code> API returns a stream of these chunks
                  starting from the chunk that you specify in the request. </p>
                  <p>The following limits apply when using the
                  <code>GetMedia</code> API:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A client can call
                  <code>GetMedia</code> up to five times per second per stream.
                  </p> </li> <li> <p>Kinesis Video Streams sends media data at a
                  rate of up to 25 megabytes per second (or 200 megabits per
                  second) during a <code>GetMedia</code> session. </p> </li>
                  </ul> <note> <p>If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis
                  Video Streams media API, in addition to the HTTP status code
                  and the response body, it includes the following pieces of
                  information: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-ErrorType</code>
                  HTTP header – contains a more specific error type in addition
                  to what the HTTP status code provides. </p> </li> <li> <p>
                  <code>x-amz-RequestId</code> HTTP header – if you want to
                  report an issue to AWS, the support team can better diagnose
                  the problem if given the Request Id.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Both
                  the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized
                  to make programmatic decisions about whether errors are
                  retry-able and under what conditions, as well as provide
                  information on what actions the client programmer might need
                  to take in order to successfully try again.</p> <p>For more
                  information, see the <b>Errors</b> section at the bottom of
                  this topic, as well as <a

                  Streams makes the initialization fragment and media fragments

                  receives the authenticated URL and requests stream metadata
                  and media data normally. When the media player requests data,
                  it calls the following actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
                  <b>GetDASHManifest:</b> Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest, which
                  contains the metadata for the media that you want to
                  playback.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>GetMP4InitFragment:</b>
                  Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The media player
                  typically loads the initialization fragment before loading any
                  media fragments. This fragment contains the
                  "<code>fytp</code>" and "<code>moov</code>" MP4 atoms, and the
                  child atoms that are needed to initialize the media player
                  decoder.</p> <p>The initialization fragment does not
                  correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis video stream. It
                  contains only the codec private data for the stream and
                  respective track, which the media player needs to decode the
                  media frames.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>GetMP4MediaFragment:</b>
                  Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments contain the
                  "<code>moof</code>" and "<code>mdat</code>" MP4 atoms and
                  their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's media
                  frames and their timestamps. </p> <note> <p>After the first
                  media fragment is made available in a streaming session, any
                  fragments that don't contain the same codec private data cause
                  an error to be returned when those different media fragments
                  are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data should not
                  change between fragments in a session. This also means that
                  the session fails if the fragments in a stream change from
                  having only video to having both audio and video.</p> </note>

                  <b>GetHLSMediaPlaylist:</b> Retrieves an HLS media playlist,
                  which contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment
                  with the <code>GetMP4InitFragment</code> action, and URLs to
                  access the MP4 media fragments with the
                  <code>GetMP4MediaFragment</code> actions. The HLS media
                  playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the
                  player needs to play it, such as whether the
                  <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>LIVE</code> or
                  <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media playlist is typically
                  static for sessions with a <code>PlaybackType</code> of
                  <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media playlist is continually
                  updated with new fragments for sessions with a
                  <code>PlaybackType</code> of <code>LIVE</code>. There is a
                  distinct HLS media playlist for the video track and the audio
                  track (if applicable) that contains MP4 media URLs for the
                  specific track. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>GetMP4InitFragment:</b>
                  Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The media player
                  typically loads the initialization fragment before loading any
                  media fragments. This fragment contains the
                  "<code>fytp</code>" and "<code>moov</code>" MP4 atoms, and the
                  child atoms that are needed to initialize the media player
                  decoder.</p> <p>The initialization fragment does not
                  correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis video stream. It
                  contains only the codec private data for the stream and
                  respective track, which the media player needs to decode the
                  media frames.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>GetMP4MediaFragment:</b>
                  Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments contain the
                  "<code>moof</code>" and "<code>mdat</code>" MP4 atoms and
                  their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's media
                  frames and their timestamps. </p> <note> <p>For the HLS
                  streaming session, in-track codec private data (CPD) changes
                  are supported. After the first media fragment is made
                  available in a streaming session, fragments can contain CPD
                  changes for each track. Therefore, the fragments in a session
                  can have a different resolution, bit rate, or other
                  information in the CPD without interrupting playback. However,
                  any change made in the track number or track codec format can
                  return an error when those different media fragments are
                  loaded. For example, streaming will fail if the fragments in
                  the stream change from having only video to having both audio
                  and video, or if an AAC audio track is changed to an ALAW
                  audio track. For each streaming session, only 500 CPD changes
                  are allowed.</p> </note> <p>Data retrieved with this action is

                  <p>An asynchronous API that updates a stream’s existing edge

                  edge configuration with the Edge Agent IoT Greengrass
                  component that runs on an IoT Hub Device, setup at your
                  premise. The time to sync can vary and depends on the
                  connectivity of the Hub Device. The <code>SyncStatus</code>
                  will be updated as the edge configuration is acknowledged, and

                  on an application that is in one of the two following states:

                  when the application is in a state other than these two
                  states, it throws a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. The

                  <code>State</code>, <code>StateReason</code>, and
                  <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response from
                  <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is
                  ready to invoke. For more information, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html">Lambda
                  function states</a>.</p> <p>A function has an unpublished
                  version, and can have published versions and aliases. The
                  unpublished version changes when you update your function's
                  code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of
                  your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An
                  alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be
                  changed to map to a different version. Use the
                  <code>Publish</code> parameter to create version
                  <code>1</code> of your function from its initial
                  configuration.</p> <p>The other parameters let you configure
                  version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify
                  version-specific settings later with
                  <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>. Function-level settings
                  apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the
                  function, and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and
                  per-function concurrency limits
                  (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>).</p> <p>You can use code
                  signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To
                  enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a
                  code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a
                  code package with <a>UpdateFunctionCode</a>, Lambda checks
                  that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted
                  publisher. The code-signing configuration includes set of
                  signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this
                  function.</p> <p>If another Amazon Web Services account or an
                  Amazon Web Service invokes your function, use
                  <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a
                  resource-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy.
                  You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version,
                  or on an alias.</p> <p>To invoke your function directly, use
                  <a>Invoke</a>. To invoke your function in response to events
                  in other Amazon Web Services, create an event source mapping
                  (<a>CreateEventSourceMapping</a>), or configure a function
                  trigger in the other service. For more information, see <a

                  By default, Lambda invokes your function synchronously (i.e.
                  the<code>InvocationType</code> is
                  <code>RequestResponse</code>). To invoke a function
                  asynchronously, set <code>InvocationType</code> to

                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq">dead-letter
                  queue</a>.</p> <p>The status code in the API response doesn't
                  reflect function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors
                  that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions

                  errors, or issues with your function's code and configuration.
                  For example, Lambda returns
                  <code>TooManyRequestsException</code> if running the function
                  would cause you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the
                  account level (<code>ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>)
                  or function level
                  (<code>ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>).</p>
                  <p>For functions with a long timeout, your client might
                  disconnect during synchronous invocation while it waits for a
                  response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or
                  operating system to allow for long connections with timeout or

      <fullname>Key Management Service</fullname> <p>Key Management Service
      (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide
      describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For
      general information about KMS, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>Key
      Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>KMS has
      replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and
      <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes,
      KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services
      provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
      programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android,
      etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
      KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take
      care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
      retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web
      Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
      </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make
      programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2
      validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web
      Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services
      Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region">Service
      endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web
      Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed
      and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends
      you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support
      cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral
      Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE).
      Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p>
      <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access
      key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use
      your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key
      for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for
      an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate
      temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All
      KMS requests must be signed with <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
      Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports
      CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related
      events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon
      S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by
      CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the
      request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail,
      including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more
      information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p>

                  created or updated but Amazon Lex returns the <code/> response
                  <code>FAILED</code>. You can build the bot after you add one
                  or more intents. For more information about Amazon Lex bots,
                  see <a>how-it-works</a>. </p> <p>If you specify the name of an
                  existing bot, the fields in the request replace the existing
                  values in the <code>$LATEST</code> version of the bot. Amazon
                  Lex removes any fields that you don't provide values for in
                  the request, except for the <code>idleTTLInSeconds</code> and
                  <code>privacySettings</code> fields, which are set to their
                  default values. If you don't specify values for required

                  <p>Creates an intent or replaces an existing intent.</p> <p>To
                  define the interaction between the user and your bot, you use
                  one or more intents. For a pizza ordering bot, for example,
                  you would create an <code>OrderPizza</code> intent. </p> <p>To
                  create an intent or replace an existing intent, you must
                  provide the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Intent name. For
                  example, <code>OrderPizza</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sample
                  utterances. For example, "Can I order a pizza, please." and "I
                  want to order a pizza."</p> </li> <li> <p>Information to be
                  gathered. You specify slot types for the information that your
                  bot will request from the user. You can specify standard slot
                  types, such as a date or a time, or custom slot types such as
                  the size and crust of a pizza.</p> </li> <li> <p>How the
                  intent will be fulfilled. You can provide a Lambda function or
                  configure the intent to return the intent information to the
                  client application. If you use a Lambda function, when all of
                  the intent information is available, Amazon Lex invokes your
                  Lambda function. If you configure your intent to return the
                  intent information to the client application. </p> </li> </ul>
                  <p>You can specify other optional information in the request,
                  such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A confirmation prompt to ask the
                  user to confirm an intent. For example, "Shall I order your
                  pizza?"</p> </li> <li> <p>A conclusion statement to send to
                  the user after the intent has been fulfilled. For example, "I
                  placed your pizza order."</p> </li> <li> <p>A follow-up prompt
                  that asks the user for additional activity. For example,
                  asking "Do you want to order a drink with your pizza?"</p>
                  </li> </ul> <p>If you specify an existing intent name to
                  update the intent, Amazon Lex replaces the values in the
                  <code>$LATEST</code> version of the intent with the values in
                  the request. Amazon Lex removes fields that you don't provide
                  in the request. If you don't specify the required fields,
                  Amazon Lex throws an exception. When you update the
                  <code>$LATEST</code> version of an intent, the

                  outages; therefore, their application is not subject to the
                  preferred maintenance window. However, there are two ways in
                  which parameter updates are applied: <code>dynamic</code> or
                  <code>pending-reboot</code>. Parameters marked with a
                  <code>dynamic</code> apply type are applied immediately.
                  Parameters marked with a <code>pending-reboot</code> apply
                  type are applied only after the database is rebooted using the
                  <code>reboot relational database</code> operation.</p> <p>The
                  <code>update relational database parameters</code> operation

      <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your

      console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon

      can use CloudWatch Logs to:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Monitor logs from EC2
      instances in real time</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor
      applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can
      track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it
      can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a
      threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for
      monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor
      application logs for specific literal terms (such as
      "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of
      a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status
      codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is
      found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you
      specify.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Monitor CloudTrail logged events</b>: You
      can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular
      API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to
      perform troubleshooting.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Archive log data</b>: You
      can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage.
      You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier
      than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent
      helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host
      and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you
      need it.</p> </li> </ul>

                  tracker resource (up to 10 devices per batch). Amazon Location
                  uses the data when it reports the last known device position
                  and position history. Amazon Location retains location data
                  for 30 days.</p> <note> <p>Position updates are handled based
                  on the <code>PositionFiltering</code> property of the tracker.
                  When <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to
                  <code>TimeBased</code>, updates are evaluated against linked
                  geofence collections, and location data is stored at a maximum
                  of one position per 30 second interval. If your update

                  <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to

                  and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the

                  if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal
                  accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is neither stored
                  or evaluated if the device has moved less than 15 m. If
                  <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to
                  <code>AccuracyBased</code> filtering, Amazon Location uses the
                  default value <code>{ "Horizontal": 0}</code> when accuracy is
                  not provided on a <code>DevicePositionUpdate</code>.</p>

      <p/> <p>Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating
      and managing blockchain networks using open-source frameworks. Blockchain
      allows you to build applications where multiple parties can securely and
      transparently run transactions and share data without the need for a
      trusted, central authority.</p> <p>Managed Blockchain supports the
      Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum open-source frameworks. Because of
      fundamental differences between the frameworks, some API actions or data
      types may only apply in the context of one framework and not the other.
      For example, actions related to Hyperledger Fabric network members such as
      <code>CreateMember</code> and <code>DeleteMember</code> don't apply to
      Ethereum.</p> <p>The description for each action indicates the framework
      or frameworks to which it applies. Data types and properties that apply
      only in the context of a particular framework are similarly indicated.</p>

      <fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname> <p>This reference
      provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service
      API.</p> <p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data
      for custom usage dimensions.</p> <p>For information on the permissions you
      need to use this API, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html">AWS
      Marketplace metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS
      Marketplace Seller Guide.</i> </p> <p> <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
      </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>MeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for an
      AWS Marketplace product. <code>MeterUsage</code> is called from an EC2
      instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>BatchMeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for a set of
      customers. <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> is called from a
      software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Accepting
      New Customers</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>ResolveCustomer</i> - Called by a
      SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your
      website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration
      Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this
      API to obtain a <code>CustomerIdentifier</code> along with the
      <code>CustomerAWSAccountId</code> and <code>ProductCode</code>.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p> <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b> </p>
      <ul> <li> <p>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace
      must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
      <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation for software entitlement and
      metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't
      required to call <code>RegisterUsage</code>, but you can do so if you want
      to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on
      using the <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based
      Products</a>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> API calls
      are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the
      SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records
      with the <code>eventName</code> of <code>BatchMeterUsage</code>. You can
      also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see
      the <i> <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS

      <p>This is the <i>AWS HealthImaging API Reference</i>. AWS HealthImaging
      is a HIPAA-eligible service that helps health care providers and their
      medical imaging ISV partners store, transform, and apply machine learning
      to medical images. For an introduction to the service, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/healthimaging/latest/devguide/what-is.html">
      <i>AWS HealthImaging Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>We recommend
      using one of the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) for your programming
      language, as they take care of request authentication, serialization, and
      connection management. For more information, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools">Tools to build on
      AWS</a>.</p> <p>For information about using HealthImaging API actions in
      one of the language-specific AWS SDKs, refer to the <i>See Also</i> link
      at the end of each section that describes an API action or data type.</p>
      </note> <p>The following sections list AWS HealthImaging API actions
      categorized according to functionality. Links are provided to actions
      within this Reference, along with links back to corresponding sections in

      <note> <p>This guide is intended for creating AWS Elemental MediaPackage
      resources in MediaPackage Version 2 (v2) starting from May 2023. To get
      started with MediaPackage v2, create your MediaPackage resources. There
      isn't an automated process to migrate your resources from MediaPackage v1
      to MediaPackage v2. </p> <p>The names of the entities that you use to
      access this API, like URLs and ARNs, all have the versioning information
      added, like "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. If you used
      MediaPackage prior to this release, you can't use the MediaPackage v2 CLI
      or the MediaPackage v2 API to access any MediaPackage v1 resources.</p>
      <p>If you created resources in MediaPackage v1, use video on demand (VOD)
      workflows, and aren't looking to migrate to MediaPackage v2 yet, see the
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/apireference/what-is.html">MediaPackage
      v1 Live API Reference</a>.</p> </note> <p>This is the AWS Elemental
      MediaPackage v2 Live REST API Reference. It describes all the MediaPackage
      API operations for live content in detail, and provides sample requests,
      responses, and errors for the supported web services protocols.</p> <p>We
      assume that you have the IAM permissions that you need to use MediaPackage
      via the REST API. We also assume that you are familiar with the features
      and operations of MediaPackage, as described in the AWS Elemental
      MediaPackage User Guide.</p>

      <p>Use the AWS Elemental MediaTailor SDKs and CLI to configure scalable ad
      insertion and linear channels. With MediaTailor, you can assemble existing
      content into a linear stream and serve targeted ads to viewers while
      maintaining broadcast quality in over-the-top (OTT) video applications.
      For information about using the service, including detailed information
      about the settings covered in this guide, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/">AWS Elemental
      MediaTailor User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Through the SDKs and the CLI you manage
      AWS Elemental MediaTailor configurations and channels the same as you do
      through the console. For example, you specify ad insertion behavior and
      mapping information for the origin server and the ad decision server
      (ADS).</p>

                  can be changed after the type has been created. However, the
                  Name and Keywords fields cannot be modified. The
                  RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be modified or added to
                  change the delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds
                  cannot be used to disable retries. </p> <p> You can use this
                  operation to update the test for a Qualification type. The
                  test is updated based on the values specified for the Test,
                  TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three
                  parameters specify the updated test. If you are updating the
                  test for a type, you must specify the Test and
                  TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The AnswerKey parameter is
                  optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does not
                  have an answer key. </p> <p> If you omit the Test parameter,
                  the test for the Qualification type is unchanged. There is no
                  way to remove a test from a Qualification type that has one.
                  If the type already has a test, you cannot update it to be
                  AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test
                  and one is provided by an update, the type will henceforth
                  have a test. </p> <p> If you want to update the test duration
                  or answer key for an existing test without changing the
                  questions, you must specify a Test parameter with the original
                  questions, along with the updated values. </p> <p> If you
                  provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will

      <p>Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web
      Services) resources and the applications you run on Amazon Web Services in
      real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are
      the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.</p>
      <p>CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the
      resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example,
      you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2
      instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch
      additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data
      to stop under-used instances to save money.</p> <p>In addition to
      monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web Services, you
      can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide
      visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
      operational health.</p>

      <fullname>Amazon Neptune</fullname> <p>Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable,
      fully-managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run
      applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Amazon
      Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine
      optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph
      with milliseconds latency. Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models
      Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query languages Apache
      TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that
      efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use
      cases such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs,
      drug discovery, and network security.</p> <p>This interface reference for
      Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a programming or command line
      interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune
      is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques
      such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been
      applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
      command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
      maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list
      following some related topics from the user guide.</p>

      <p>Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage
      links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using
      <i>CloudWatch cross-account observability</i>. With CloudWatch
      cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications
      that span multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize,
      and analyze your metrics, logs, traces, and Application Insights
      applications in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries.</p>
      <p>Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as <i>monitoring
      accounts</i> and link them with multiple <i>source accounts</i>. A
      monitoring account is a central Amazon Web Services account that can view
      and interact with observability data generated from source accounts. A
      source account is an individual Amazon Web Services account that generates
      observability data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts
      share their observability data with the monitoring account. The shared
      observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in
      Amazon CloudWatch Logs, traces in X-Ray, and applications in Amazon
      CloudWatch Application Insights.</p>

      <p>This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for
      developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API
      actions, data types, and errors. </p> <ul> <li> <p>The REST API requires
      you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling
      request retries, and error handling. For general information about using
      the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon
      Web Services APIs</a>. </p> <p>To access Network Firewall using the REST
      API endpoint: <code>https://network-firewall.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com
      </code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon
      Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming
      language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and
      step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall
      console, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/">Network
      Firewall Developer Guide</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Network Firewall is a
      stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention
      service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network
      Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This
      includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway,
      NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules
      that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis
      and threat detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version
      6.0.9. For information about Suricata, see the <a
      href="https://suricata.io/">Suricata website</a>.</p> <p>You can use
      Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of
      ways. The following are just a few examples: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Allow
      domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints,
      such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain
      names that your applications can access.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform deep
      packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS,
      regardless of the port used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To enable Network Firewall
      for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network
      Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/">Amazon VPC User
      Guide</a>.</p> <p>To start using Network Firewall, do the following: </p>
      <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to
      protect, create it in Amazon VPC. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, in
      each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create
      a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall. </p> </li> <li> <p>In
      Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the
      components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your
      firewall to have. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create a
      firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional
      default traffic filtering behavior. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network
      Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC
      subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that
      you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route
      traffic through the new firewall endpoints.</p> </li> </ol>

      <fullname>AWS OpsWorks CM</fullname> <p>AWS OpsWorks for configuration
      management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration
      management servers. You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS
      OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers,
      and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.</p> <p> <b>Glossary of
      terms</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A configuration management
      server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server
      runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use
      various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service
      (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over
      the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In
      AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create
      servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you
      want to use. Valid values in this release include
      <code>ChefAutomate</code> and <code>Puppet</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the
      configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for
      backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of
      a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup
      starts.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a
      server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run,
      when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When
      you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are
      assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store
      information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your
      customer account. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>AWS
      OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect
      to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or
      managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li>

      <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage
      encryption keys for use during payment-related cryptographic operations.
      You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can
      also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For
      more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and access management</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment
      Cryptography User Guide.</i> </p> <p>To use encryption keys for
      payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic
      operations, you use the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon
      Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane</a>. You can perform actions
      like encrypt, decrypt, generate, and verify payment-related data.</p>
      <p>All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed
      and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend you
      always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests. </p>
      <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for
      control plane operations, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API
      calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers
      them to an Amazon S3 bucket you specify. By using the information
      collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to
      Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when it
      was made, and so on. If you don't conﬁgure a trail, you can still view the
      most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more information, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail

                  translations are guided by PCI. It is important to note that
                  not all encrypted PIN block formats (example, format 1)
                  require PAN (Primary Account Number) as input. And as such,
                  PIN block format that requires PAN (example, formats 0,3,4)
                  cannot be translated to a format (format 1) that does not
                  require a PAN for generation. </p> <p>For information about

      <fullname>Amazon Pinpoint Email Service</fullname> <p>Welcome to the
      <i>Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference</i>. This guide provides
      information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including
      supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.</p> <p> <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon Pinpoint</a> is an AWS
      service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple
      messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text
      messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint
      Email API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the
      email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint
      API.</p> <p>If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to
      also review the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">Amazon
      Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>. The <i>Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</i>
      provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to
      use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon
      Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications.
      The guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon
      Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply to
      using the service.</p> <p>The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in
      several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions.
      For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently
      available, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region">AWS
      Service Endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.
      To learn more about AWS Regions, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing
      AWS Regions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
      <p>In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These
      Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united
      by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network
      connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high
      levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To
      learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in
      each Region, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global
      Infrastructure</a>.</p>

                  configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply

                  you have specified in the request; the rest remain unchanged.
                  The exception to this is if you modify any Amazon Web

                  updates the fields in these objects atomically as one and
                  overrides existing values. This is by design, and means that
                  if you don't specify an optional field in one of these

      <p>This is the Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions,
      syntax and usage examples for each of the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">actions</a>
      and <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html">data
      types</a> for the Proton service.</p> <p>The documentation for each action
      shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can use the Amazon Web Services CLI to access an
      API. For more information, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Amazon
      Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide</a>.</p> <p>The Proton
      service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create
      service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment
      tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in
      turn, select from the available service templates to automate their
      application or service deployments.</p> <p>Because administrators define
      the infrastructure and tooling that Proton deploys and manages, they need
      permissions to use all of the listed API operations.</p> <p>When
      developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, Proton
      deploys their applications. To monitor their applications that are running
      on Proton, developers need permissions to the service <i>create</i>,
      <i>list</i>, <i>update</i> and <i>delete</i> API operations and the
      service instance <i>list</i> and <i>update</i> API operations.</p> <p>To
      learn more about Proton, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/Welcome.html">Proton
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Ensuring Idempotency</b> </p> <p>When you make
      a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the
      asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might
      also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete,
      even if the request already returned a result. This might make it
      difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might
      need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation
      completes successfully. However, if the original request and the
      subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times.
      This means that you might create more resources than you intended.</p> <p>
      <i>Idempotency</i> ensures that an API request action completes no more
      than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action
      completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully
      without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain
      updated information, such as the current creation status.</p> <p>The
      following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure
      idempotency.</p> <p> <b>Idempotent create APIs with a client token</b>
      </p> <p>The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a
      <i>client token</i>. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands
      also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique,
      case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent
      API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the
      request. We recommend that you <i>don't</i> reuse the same client token
      for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these
      APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs.</p>
      <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the
      request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry
      succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the
      original resource detail data in the response.</p> <p>If you retry the
      request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are
      different, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an
      <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Client tokens
      expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with
      the expired token, a new resource is created.</p> <p>If the original
      resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is
      created.</p> <p>Idempotent create APIs with a client token:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li>

      create APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p>
      <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original
      resource <i>hasn't</i> been modified, the retry succeeds without
      performing any further actions other than returning the original resource
      detail data in the response.</p> <p>If the original resource has been
      modified, the retry throws a <code>ConflictException</code>.</p> <p>If you
      retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a
      <code>ValidationException</code> with an
      <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Idempotent create

      <li> <p>CreateService</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent delete APIs</b>
      </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>When you retry
      the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its
      metadata is returned in the response.</p> <p>If you retry and the resource
      doesn't exist, the response is empty.</p> <p>In both cases, the retry
      succeeds.</p> <p>Idempotent delete APIs:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplate</p> </li> <li>

      the original request delete operation status is
      <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, the retry returns the resource detail
      data in the response without performing any further actions.</p> <p>If the

      implements <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/abuse-detection.html">automated
      abuse detection</a>. Because Amazon Q in Connect is built on Amazon
      Bedrock, users can take full advantage of the controls implemented in
      Amazon Bedrock to enforce safety, security, and the responsible use of
      artificial intelligence (AI).</p> </note> <p>Amazon Q in Connect is a
      generative AI customer service assistant. It is an LLM-enhanced evolution
      of Amazon Connect Wisdom that delivers real-time recommendations to help
      contact center agents resolve customer issues quickly and accurately.</p>
      <p>Amazon Q automatically detects customer intent during calls and chats
      using conversational analytics and natural language understanding (NLU).
      It then provides agents with immediate, real-time generative responses and
      suggested actions, and links to relevant documents and articles. Agents
      can also query Amazon Q directly using natural language or keywords to
      answer customer requests.</p> <p>Use the Amazon Q in Connect APIs to
      create an assistant and a knowledge base, for example, or manage content
      by uploading custom files.</p> <p>For more information, see <a

      Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different
      dimensions of database load based on data captured from a running DB
      instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance
      Insights data types, parameters and errors.</p> <p>When Performance
      Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides
      visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch
      provides the authoritative source for Amazon Web Services service-vended
      monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of
      DB load.</p> <p>DB load is measured as average active sessions.
      Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
      two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load
      data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time point
      decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured
      at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.</p>

      <p>The Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient
      way to programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services, products,
      and pricing information. The Amazon Web Services Price List uses
      standardized product attributes such as <code>Location</code>,
      <code>Storage Class</code>, and <code>Operating System</code>, and
      provides prices at the SKU level. You can use the Amazon Web Services
      Price List to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Build cost control and
      scenario planning tools</p> </li> <li> <p>Reconcile billing data</p> </li>
      <li> <p>Forecast future spend for budgeting purposes</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Provide cost benefit analysis that compare your internal workloads with
      Amazon Web Services</p> </li> </ul> <p>Use <code>GetServices</code>
      without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all Amazon Web
      Services, then <code>GetServices</code> with a service code to retrieve
      the attribute names for that service. After you have the service code and
      attribute names, you can use <code>GetAttributeValues</code> to see what
      values are available for an attribute. With the service code and an
      attribute name and value, you can use <code>GetProducts</code> to find
      specific products that you're interested in, such as an
      <code>AmazonEC2</code> instance, with a <code>Provisioned IOPS</code>
      <code>volumeType</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a

      <p>The transactional data APIs for Amazon QLDB</p> <note> <p>Instead of

      </li> <li> <p>If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS

      <p>This is the <i>Resource Access Manager API Reference</i>. This
      documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and
      data types in RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your
      Amazon Web Services resources to other Amazon Web Services accounts. If
      you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you can share your
      resources with your entire organization or to organizational units (OUs).
      For supported resource types, you can also share resources with individual
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users. </p> <p>To learn
      more about RAM, see the following resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a

      <fullname>Amazon Redshift</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is
      an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for
      one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage
      Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which
      means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or
      asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been
      applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
      change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
      next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster
      management interfaces, go to <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html">Using
      the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces</a>.</p> <p>Amazon Redshift
      manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data
      warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster,
      and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can
      focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and
      customers.</p> <p>If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we
      recommend that you begin by reading the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html">Amazon
      Redshift Getting Started Guide</a>.</p> <p>If you are a database
      developer, the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html">Amazon
      Redshift Database Developer Guide</a> explains how to design, build,

      <p>This is the <i>Recycle Bin API Reference</i>. This documentation
      provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in
      Recycle Bin.</p> <p>Recycle Bin is a resource recovery feature that
      enables you to restore accidentally deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs.
      When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are deleted, they are retained
      in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify.</p> <p>You can
      restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention
      period expires. After you restore a resource from the Recycle Bin, the
      resource is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use it in the
      same way you use any other resource of that type in your account. If the
      retention period expires and the resource is not restored, the resource is
      permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available for
      recovery. For more information about Recycle Bin, see <a

                  combinations of request parameters: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Secrets
                  Manager - when connecting to a cluster, provide the
                  <code>secret-arn</code> of a secret stored in Secrets Manager
                  which has <code>username</code> and <code>password</code>. The
                  specified secret contains credentials to connect to the
                  <code>database</code> you specify. When you are connecting to
                  a cluster, you also supply the database name, If you provide a
                  cluster identifier (<code>dbClusterIdentifier</code>), it must
                  match the cluster identifier stored in the secret. When you
                  are connecting to a serverless workgroup, you also supply the
                  database name.</p> </li> <li> <p>Temporary credentials - when
                  connecting to your data warehouse, choose one of the following
                  options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When connecting to a serverless
                  workgroup, specify the workgroup name and database name. The
                  database user name is derived from the IAM identity. For
                  example, <code>arn:iam::123456789012:user:foo</code> has the
                  database user name <code>IAM:foo</code>. Also, permission to
                  call the <code>redshift-serverless:GetCredentials</code>
                  operation is required.</p> </li> <li> <p>When connecting to a
                  cluster as an IAM identity, specify the cluster identifier and
                  the database name. The database user name is derived from the
                  IAM identity. For example,
                  <code>arn:iam::123456789012:user:foo</code> has the database
                  user name <code>IAM:foo</code>. Also, permission to call the
                  <code>redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM</code> operation
                  is required.</p> </li> <li> <p>When connecting to a cluster as
                  a database user, specify the cluster identifier, the database
                  name, and the database user name. Also, permission to call the

      <p>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and
      discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your
      resources using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of
      resources include Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
      instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon
      DynamoDB tables. You can search for your resources using resource metadata
      like names, tags, and IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all of the
      Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in which you turn the service
      on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.</p> <p>Resource Explorer
      scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your
      Amazon Web Services account in which you turn on Resource Explorer.
      Resource Explorer <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index">creates
      and maintains an index</a> in each Region, with the details of that
      Region's resources.</p> <p>You can <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html">search
      across all of the indexed Regions in your account</a> by designating one
      of your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator index for
      the account. When you <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html">promote
      a local index in a Region to become the aggregator index for the
      account</a>, Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index
      information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator
      index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all
      resource information for all Regions in the account where you turned on
      Resource Explorer. As a result, views in the aggregator index Region
      include resources from all of the indexed Regions in your account.</p>
      <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer,
      including how to enable and configure the service, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/">Amazon
      Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide</a>.</p>

                  resources in the index so that they can be queried by using
                  the <a>Search</a> operation. You can create only one index in
                  a Region.</p> <note> <p>This operation creates only a
                  <i>local</i> index. To promote the local index in one Amazon
                  Web Services Region into the aggregator index for the Amazon
                  Web Services account, use the <a>UpdateIndexType</a>

                  Explorer index. Resource information from all other Regions is
                  replicated to this Region's index.</p> <p>When you change the
                  index type to <code>AGGREGATOR</code>, Resource Explorer turns
                  on replication of all discovered resource information from the
                  other Amazon Web Services Regions in your account to this
                  index. You can then, from this Region only, perform resource
                  search queries that span all Amazon Web Services Regions in
                  the Amazon Web Services account. Turning on replication from
                  all other Regions is performed by asynchronous background
                  tasks. You can check the status of the asynchronous tasks by
                  using the <a>GetIndex</a> operation. When the asynchronous
                  tasks complete, the <code>Status</code> response of that
                  operation changes from <code>UPDATING</code> to
                  <code>ACTIVE</code>. After that, you can start to see results
                  from other Amazon Web Services Regions in query results.
                  However, it can take several hours for replication from all
                  other Regions to complete.</p> <important> <p>You can have
                  only one aggregator index per Amazon Web Services account.
                  Before you can promote a different index to be the aggregator
                  index for the account, you must first demote the existing
                  aggregator index to type <code>LOCAL</code>.</p> </important>

                  <p>The index contains information about resources in only the
                  Amazon Web Services Region in which the index exists. If an
                  aggregator index in another Region exists, then information in
                  this local index is replicated to the aggregator index.</p>
                  <p>When you change the index type to <code>LOCAL</code>,
                  Resource Explorer turns off the replication of resource
                  information from all other Amazon Web Services Regions in the
                  Amazon Web Services account to this Region. The aggregator
                  index remains in the <code>UPDATING</code> state until all
                  replication with other Regions successfully stops. You can
                  check the status of the asynchronous task by using the
                  <a>GetIndex</a> operation. When Resource Explorer successfully
                  stops all replication with other Regions, the
                  <code>Status</code> response of that operation changes from
                  <code>UPDATING</code> to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Separately, the
                  resource information from other Regions that was previously
                  stored in the index is deleted within 30 days by another
                  background task. Until that asynchronous task completes, some
                  results from other Regions can continue to appear in search
                  results.</p> <important> <p>After you demote an aggregator

                  <p>Removes the specified tags from the specified resources.
                  When you specify a tag key, the action removes both that key
                  and its associated value. The operation succeeds even if you
                  attempt to remove tags from a resource that were already
                  removed. Note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To remove tags
                  from a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the
                  service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions
                  for removing tags. For more information, see the documentation
                  for the service whose resource you want to untag.</p> </li>
                  <li> <p>You can only tag resources that are located in the
                  specified Amazon Web Services Region for the calling Amazon
                  Web Services account.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Minimum
                  permissions</b> </p> <p>In addition to the
                  <code>tag:UntagResources</code> permission required by this
                  operation, you must also have the remove tags permission
                  defined by the service that created the resource. For example,
                  to remove the tags from an Amazon EC2 instance using the
                  <code>UntagResources</code> operation, you must have both of
                  the following permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
                  <code>tag:UntagResource</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
                  <code>ec2:DeleteTags</code> </p> </l

      <p>Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for
      your workloads such as servers, containers, and applications that run
      outside of Amazon Web Services to obtain temporary Amazon Web Services
      credentials. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and roles you
      have for native Amazon Web Services applications to access Amazon Web
      Services resources. Using IAM Roles Anywhere eliminates the need to manage
      long-term credentials for workloads running outside of Amazon Web
      Services.</p> <p> To use IAM Roles Anywhere, your workloads must use X.509
      certificates issued by their certificate authority (CA). You register the
      CA with IAM Roles Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish trust between
      your public key infrastructure (PKI) and IAM Roles Anywhere. If you don't
      manage your own PKI system, you can use Private Certificate Authority to
      create a CA and then use that to establish trust with IAM Roles Anywhere.
      </p> <p>This guide describes the IAM Roles Anywhere operations that you
      can call programmatically. For more information about IAM Roles Anywhere,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html">IAM
      Roles Anywhere User Guide</a>.</p>

      <p>Resource Groups lets you organize Amazon Web Services resources such as
      Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Service
      databases, and Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets into groups using
      criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is a collection of
      resources that match the resource types specified in a query, and share
      one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of resources
      based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages,
      regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource Groups
      enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in Amazon Web
      Services Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in
      Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let
      you quickly view a custom console in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
      that shows Config compliance and other monitoring data about member
      resources.</p> <p>To create a resource group, build a resource query, and
      specify tags that identify the criteria that members of the group have in
      common. Tags are key-value pairs.</p> <p>For more information about
      Resource Groups, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html">Resource
      Groups User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API
      that you can use to perform the following types of operations.</p> <ul>
      <li> <p>Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource
      groups and resource query entities</p> </li> <li> <p>Applying, editing,
      and removing tags from resource groups</p> </li> <li> <p>Resolving
      resource group member ARNs so they can be returned as search results</p>
      </li> <li> <p>Getting data about resources that are members of a group</p>
      </li> <li> <p>Searching Amazon Web Services resources based on a resource
      query</p> </li> </ul>

      <p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide
      for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p> <p>With Route 53
      ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to recover
      applications by rerouting traffic across Availability Zones or Amazon Web
      Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a
      highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five
      redundant Regional endpoints against which you can run API calls to get or
      update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set one
      routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one
      Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another. </p> <p> <i>Be
      aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you
      work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states
      in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon)
      Region for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter
      <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands. For more
      information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
      Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon
      Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <p>This API
      guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and
      update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing
      control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components
      (clusters, control panels, and routing controls) using the recovery
      cluster configuration API.</p> <p>For more information about working with
      routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>Create clusters, control panels, and routing controls by using API
      operations. For more information, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/">Recovery
      Control Configuration API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application
      Recovery Controller</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn about the components in
      recovery control, including clusters, routing controls, and control
      panels, and how to work with Route 53 ARC in the Amazon Web Services
      console. For more information, see <a

      Recovery control components</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application
      Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> </li> <li> <p>Route 53 ARC also
      provides readiness checks that continually audit resources to help make
      sure that your applications are scaled and ready to handle failover
      traffic. For more information about the related API operations, see the <a

                  for each state to be ON or OFF. When the state is ON, traffic
                  flows to a cell. When it's OFF, traffic does not flow.</p>
                  <p>With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for routing
                  controls, which are safeguards for routing control state
                  updates that help prevent unexpected outcomes, like fail open
                  traffic routing. However, there are scenarios when you might
                  want to bypass the routing control safeguards that are
                  enforced with safety rules that you've configured. For
                  example, you might want to fail over quickly for disaster
                  recovery, and one or more safety rules might be unexpectedly
                  preventing you from updating a routing control state to
                  reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario like this, you
                  can override one or more safety rules to change a routing
                  control state and fail over your application.</p> <p>The
                  <code>SafetyRulesToOverride</code> property enables you
                  override one or more safety rules and update routing control
                  states. For more information, see <a

                  <p>Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which
                  contains authoritative DNS information for a specified domain
                  name or subdomain name. For example, you can use
                  <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> to create a resource
                  record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web
                  server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.</p> <p>
                  <b>Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>To delete a
                  resource record set, you must specify all the same values that
                  you specified when you created it.</p> <p> <b>Change Batches
                  and Transactional Changes</b> </p> <p>The request body must
                  include a document with a
                  <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The
                  request body contains a list of change items, known as a
                  change batch. Change batches are considered transactional
                  changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and
                  then either makes all or none of the changes in the change
                  batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely
                  affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a
                  hosted zone. </p> <p>For example, suppose a change batch
                  request contains two changes: it deletes the
                  <code>CNAME</code> resource record set for www.example.com and
                  creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If
                  validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the
                  first resource record set and creates the second resource
                  record set in a single operation. If validation for either the
                  <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails,
                  then the request is canceled, and the original
                  <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist.</p> <note> <p>If
                  you try to delete the same resource record set more than once
                  in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an
                  <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.</p> </note> <p>
                  <b>Traffic Flow</b> </p> <p>To create resource record sets for
                  complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow
                  visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for
                  traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the
                  configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic
                  policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or
                  subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted
                  zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the
                  updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected.

                  Upsert</b> </p> <p>Use
                  <code>ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest</code> to perform the
                  following actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>CREATE</code>:
                  Creates a resource record set that has the specified
                  values.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code>: Deletes an
                  existing resource record set that has the specified
                  values.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UPSERT</code>: If a resource
                  set doesn't exist, Route 53 creates it. If a resource set
                  exists Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.
                  </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and
                  Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>The syntax for a
                  request depends on the type of resource record set that you
                  want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or
                  failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the
                  order listed in the syntax. </p> <p>For an example for each
                  type of resource record set, see "Examples."</p> <p>Don't
                  refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which
                  includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record
                  set that you can create, delete, or update by using
                  <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code>. </p> <p> <b>Change
                  Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers</b> </p> <p>When you
                  submit a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, Route
                  53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53
                  authoritative DNS servers managing the hosted zone. While your
                  changes are propagating, <code>GetChange</code> returns a
                  status of <code>PENDING</code>. When propagation is complete,
                  <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of
                  <code>INSYNC</code>. Changes generally propagate to all Route
                  53 name servers managing the hosted zone within 60 seconds.

                  one page of results, the value of <code>IsTruncated</code> is
                  <code>true</code>. To display the next page of results, get

                  <code>NextRecordType</code>, and
                  <code>NextRecordIdentifier</code> (if any) from the response.
                  Then submit another <code>ListResourceRecordSets</code>
                  request, and specify those values for
                  <code>StartRecordName</code>, <code>StartRecordType</code>,

                  structured to prevent and recover Amazon Web Services
                  application disruptions. To describe a Resilience Hub
                  application, you provide an application name, resources from
                  one or more CloudFormation stacks, Resource Groups, Terraform
                  state files, AppRegistry applications, and an appropriate
                  resiliency policy. In addition, you can also add resources
                  that are located on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon
                  EKS) clusters as optional resources. For more information

      <p>When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS
      resolution within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver
      answers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2
      instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers. Resolver performs
      recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain
      names.</p> <p>You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and
      your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:</p> <p> <b>Forward
      DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver</b> </p>
      <p>DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a
      specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain
      names for Amazon Web Services resources such as EC2 instances or records
      in a Route 53 private hosted zone. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-network-to-vpc">How
      DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver</a>
      in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Conditionally
      forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network</b> </p> <p>You
      can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2
      instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward
      selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names
      for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and
      the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to
      forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com,
      acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match
      (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you
      specified in that rule. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network">How
      Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network</a>
      in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Like Amazon VPC,
      Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you can choose
      whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound
      queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.</p>

      <p>Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint
      provides a set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the
      runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For
      example, suppose a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to
      Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user
      request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the
      bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to
      elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust
      type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when
      you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your
      Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time
      API, . </p>

                  </p> <ul> <li> <p> For a user input "I would like a pizza,"
                  Amazon Lex might return a response with a message eliciting
                  slot data (for example, <code>PizzaSize</code>): "What size
                  pizza would you like?". </p> </li> <li> <p> After the user
                  provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might
                  return a response with a message to get user confirmation:
                  "Order the pizza?". </p> </li> <li> <p> After the user replies
                  "Yes" to the confirmation prompt, Amazon Lex might return a
                  conclusion statement: "Thank you, your cheese pizza has been
                  ordered.". </p> </li> </ul> <p> Not all Amazon Lex messages
                  require a response from the user. For example, conclusion
                  statements do not require a response. Some messages require
                  only a yes or no response. In addition to the
                  <code>message</code>, Amazon Lex provides additional context
                  about the message in the response that you can use to enhance
                  client behavior, such as displaying the appropriate client
                  user interface. Consider the following examples: </p> <ul>
                  <li> <p> If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex
                  returns the following context information: </p> <ul> <li> <p>
                  <code>x-amz-lex-dialog-state</code> header set to
                  <code>ElicitSlot</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
                  <code>x-amz-lex-intent-name</code> header set to the intent
                  name in the current context </p> </li> <li> <p>
                  <code>x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit</code> header set to the slot
                  name for which the <code>message</code> is eliciting
                  information </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-lex-slots</code>
                  header set to a map of slots configured for the intent with
                  their current values </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> If the
                  message is a confirmation prompt, the
                  <code>x-amz-lex-dialog-state</code> header is set to
                  <code>Confirmation</code> and the
                  <code>x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit</code> header is omitted. </p>
                  </li> <li> <p> If the message is a clarification prompt
                  configured for the intent, indicating that the user intent is
                  not understood, the <code>x-amz-dialog-state</code> header is
                  set to <code>ElicitIntent</code> and the
                  <code>x-amz-slot-to-elicit</code> header is omitted. </p>
                  </li> </ul> <p> In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your
                  application-specific <code>sessionAttributes</code>. For more
                  information, see <a

                  <p>Sends user input to Amazon Lex. Client applications can use
                  this API to send requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex
                  then interprets the user input using the machine learning
                  model it built for the bot. </p> <p> In response, Amazon Lex
                  returns the next <code>message</code> to convey to the user an

                  following example messages: </p> <ul> <li> <p> For a user
                  input "I would like a pizza", Amazon Lex might return a

                  PizzaSize): "What size pizza would you like?" </p> </li> <li>
                  <p> After the user provides all of the pizza order
                  information, Amazon Lex might return a response with a message
                  to obtain user confirmation "Proceed with the pizza order?".
                  </p> </li> <li> <p> After the user replies to a confirmation
                  prompt with a "yes", Amazon Lex might return a conclusion
                  statement: "Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.".
                  </p> </li> </ul> <p> Not all Amazon Lex messages require a
                  user response. For example, a conclusion statement does not
                  require a response. Some messages require only a "yes" or "no"
                  user response. In addition to the <code>message</code>, Amazon
                  Lex provides additional context about the message in the
                  response that you might use to enhance client behavior, for
                  example, to display the appropriate client user interface.
                  These are the <code>slotToElicit</code>,
                  <code>dialogState</code>, <code>intentName</code>, and
                  <code>slots</code> fields in the response. Consider the
                  following examples: </p> <ul> <li> <p>If the message is to
                  elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the following context
                  information:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>dialogState</code> set to

                  <code>slotToElicit</code> set to the slot name for which the

      <p>With Amazon CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real-user monitoring to
      collect client-side data about your web application performance from
      actual user sessions in real time. The data collected includes page load
      times, client-side errors, and user behavior. When you view this data, you
      can see it all aggregated together and also see breakdowns by the browsers
      and devices that your customers use.</p> <p>You can use the collected data
      to quickly identify and debug client-side performance issues. CloudWatch
      RUM helps you visualize anomalies in your application performance and find
      relevant debugging data such as error messages, stack traces, and user
      sessions. You can also use RUM to understand the range of end-user impact
      including the number of users, geolocations, and browsers used.</p>

                  such as replication rules</p> </li> </ul> <p>A replication
                  configuration must include at least one rule and can contain a
                  maximum of 100. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to
                  replicate by filtering the objects in the source Outposts
                  bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate,

                  objects in the source Outposts bucket to apply a replication
                  rule to, add the <code>Filter</code> element as a child of the
                  <code>Rule</code> element. You can filter objects based on an
                  object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you
                  add the <code>Filter</code> element in the configuration, you
                  must also add the following elements:

                  against the tagging subresource that is associated with the
                  job. To modify the existing tag set, you can either replace
                  the existing tag set entirely, or make changes within the
                  existing tag set by retrieving the existing tag set using <a

      <p>Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment to
      any machine learning application. When an AI application can't evaluate
      data with a high degree of confidence, human reviewers can take over. This
      human review is called a human review workflow. To create and start a
      human review workflow, you need three resources: a <i>worker task
      template</i>, a <i>flow definition</i>, and a <i>human loop</i>.</p>
      <p>For information about these resources and prerequisites for using
      Amazon A2I, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html">Get
      Started with Amazon Augmented AI</a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer
      Guide.</p> <p>This API reference includes information about API actions
      and data types that you can use to interact with Amazon A2I
      programmatically. Use this guide to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Start a human loop
      with the <code>StartHumanLoop</code> operation when using Amazon A2I with
      a <i>custom task type</i>. To learn more about the difference between
      custom and built-in task types, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html">Use
      Task Types </a>. To learn how to start a human loop using this API, see <a

      and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type </a> in the Amazon SageMaker
      Developer Guide.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manage your human loops. You can list
      all human loops that you have created, describe individual human loops,
      and stop and delete human loops. To learn more, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-monitor-humanloop-results.html">Monitor
      and Manage Your Human Loop </a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer

      services to create and start human review workflows for those services. To
      learn how Amazon A2I uses these APIs, see <a

                  upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the
                  parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this
                  upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see

                  or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded
                  parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload.
                  Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stops
                  charging you for storing them only after you either complete
                  or abort a multipart upload. </p> </note> <p>If you have
                  configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart
                  uploads, the created multipart upload must be completed within

                  configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload
                  becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the

                  <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for
                  session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
                  <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the
                  directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based
                  policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call
                  on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session
                  token in your request header, you can make API requests to
                  this operation. After the session token expires, you make
                  another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new
                  session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
                  session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid

                  buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
                  rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in
                  its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3
                  automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an
                  S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify
                  encryption information in your request, the encryption setting
                  of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption
                  configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all
                  buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that
                  uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
                  (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption
                  configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key
                  Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided
                  encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS
                  key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts.
                  When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you
                  want to use a different type of encryption setting for the
                  uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the
                  object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3
                  managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the
                  encryption setting in your request is different from the
                  default encryption configuration of the destination bucket,
                  the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If
                  you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request

                  </p> <p>To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory
                  bucket, use the <code>CreateSession</code> API operation.
                  Specifically, you grant <code>s3express:CreateSession</code>
                  permission to a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM
                  identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make
                  the <code>CreateSession</code> API request on the bucket,
                  which returns temporary security credentials that include the
                  access key ID, secret access key, session token, and
                  expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to
                  access the Zonal endpoint APIs. After the session is created,
                  you don’t need to use other policies to grant permissions to
                  each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal
                  endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the
                  temporary security credentials of the session to the request
                  headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication.
                  You also apply the session token to the
                  <code>x-amz-s3session-token</code> request header for
                  authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to
                  the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration
                  time, any calls that you make with those credentials will
                  fail. You must use IAM credentials again to make a
                  <code>CreateSession</code> API request that generates a new
                  set of temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials
                  cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original specified
                  interval.</p> <p>If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs
                  handle the session token refreshes automatically to avoid
                  service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend
                  that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and
                  manage requests to the CreateSession API. For more

                  be allowed to perform the <code>s3:PutBucketCORS</code>
                  action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and
                  can grant it to others.</p> <p>You set this configuration on a
                  bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests.
                  For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin
                  is <code>http://www.example.com</code> to access your Amazon
                  S3 bucket at <code>my.example.bucket.com</code> by using the
                  browser's <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> capability.</p> <p>To
                  enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you
                  add the <code>cors</code> subresource to the bucket. The
                  <code>cors</code> subresource is an XML document in which you
                  configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods
                  that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited
                  to 64 KB in size. </p> <p>When Amazon S3 receives a
                  cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against
                  a bucket, it evaluates the <code>cors</code> configuration on
                  the bucket and uses the first <code>CORSRule</code> rule that
                  matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin
                  request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be
                  met:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The request's <code>Origin</code> header
                  must match <code>AllowedOrigin</code> elements.</p> </li> <li>
                  <p>The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on)
                  or the <code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code> header in
                  case of a pre-flight <code>OPTIONS</code> request must be one
                  of the <code>AllowedMethod</code> elements. </p> </li> <li>
                  <p>Every header specified in the
                  <code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code> request header of
                  a pre-flight request must match an <code>AllowedHeader</code>

                  impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
                  delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high
                  throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on

                  the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
                  and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be
                  stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access
                  tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.</p>

                  of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A filter identifying a
                  subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be

                  and <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> API actions, even if their
                  bucket policy explicitly denies the root principal's access.
                  Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from

                  <p>This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from
                  a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object
                  keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a
                  suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests,
                  reducing per-request overhead.</p> <p>The request can contain
                  a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML,
                  you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs
                  if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a
                  versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
                  delete operation and returns the result of that delete,
                  success or failure, in the response. Note that if the object
                  specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the
                  result as deleted.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Directory

                  Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p>The operation supports
                  two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the
                  operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the
                  result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode
                  the response includes only keys where the delete operation
                  encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet
                  mode, the operation does not return any information about the
                  delete in the response body.</p> <p>When performing this
                  action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to
                  delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token.
                  If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even
                  if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete.
                  If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned
                  keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete

                  token in your request header, you can make API requests to

                  Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the

                  Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more
                  information, see <a

                  </important> <dl> <dt>Permissions</dt> <dd> <p>You can set
                  access permissions by using one of the following methods:</p>
                  <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the
                  <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a
                  set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each
                  canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions.
                  Specify the canned ACL name as the value of
                  <code>x-amz-acl</code>. If you use this header, you cannot use
                  other access control-specific headers in your request. For
                  more information, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned
                  ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions
                  explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>,
                  <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>,
                  <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and
                  <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using
                  these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and
                  grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups)
                  who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific
                  headers, you cannot use the <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to
                  set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of
                  permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more

                  <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the
                  email address of an Amazon Web Services account</p> <note>

                  configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners
                  can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to
                  set this configuration with the required
                  <code>s3:PutBucketNotification</code> permission.</p> <note>
                  <p>The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example,
                  suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic,
                  SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a
                  PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test
                  messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire
                  PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the
                  configuration to your bucket.</p> </note> <p>If the
                  configuration in the request body includes only one
                  <code>TopicConfiguration</code> specifying only the
                  <code>s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject</code> event type, the
                  response will also include the

                  set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL
                  has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the

                  <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using

                  grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups)
                  who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific

                  <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for

                  directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based
                  policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call
                  on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session
                  token in your request header, you can make API requests to
                  this operation. After the session token expires, you make
                  another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new
                  session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create

                  returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads in the response.
                  The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default
                  value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a
                  response by specifying the <code>max-uploads</code> request
                  parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that
                  satisfy your <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> request, the
                  response returns an <code>IsTruncated</code> element with the
                  value of <code>true</code>, a <code>NextKeyMarker</code>
                  element, and a <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> element. To
                  list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make
                  subsequent <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> requests. In
                  these requests, include two query parameters:
                  <code>key-marker</code> and <code>upload-id-marker</code>. Set
                  the value of <code>key-marker</code> to the
                  <code>NextKeyMarker</code> value from the previous response.
                  Similarly, set the value of <code>upload-id-marker</code> to
                  the <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> value from the previous
                  response.</p> <note> <p> <b>Directory buckets</b> - The
                  <code>upload-id-marker</code> element and the
                  <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> element aren't supported by
                  directory buckets. To list the additional multipart uploads,
                  you only need to set the value of <code>key-marker</code> to
                  the <code>NextKeyMarker</code> value from the previous
                  response. </p> </note> <p>For more information about multipart

                  available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create
                  a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your
                  S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the

                  largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using
                  Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5
                  minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity
                  for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it.

                  update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a
                  new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative
                  to the current time and charges only for the request-there are
                  no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration
                  period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current
                  restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a

                  expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life
                  span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if
                  you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
                  scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in

      usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to a consistent
      amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years, and receive
      a lower price for that usage. For more information, see the <a

      <p> Amazon EventBridge Scheduler is a serverless scheduler that allows you
      to create, run, and manage tasks from one central, managed service.
      EventBridge Scheduler delivers your tasks reliably, with built-in
      mechanisms that adjust your schedules based on the availability of
      downstream targets. The following reference lists the available API
      actions, and data types for EventBridge Scheduler. </p>

      Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of
      data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort
      associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB
      provides developers the freedom to focus on application development. <p> A
      traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront
      capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and
      repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically
      simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and
      providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates
      the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and
      performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within
      Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and
      pay only for what they use. </p> <p> Visit <a

                  SELECT statement. </p> <p> The total size of the response
                  cannot exceed 1 MB in total size. Amazon SimpleDB
                  automatically adjusts the number of items returned per page to
                  enforce this limit. For example, if the client asks to
                  retrieve 2500 items, but each individual item is 10 kB in
                  size, the system returns 100 items and an appropriate

      <p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers
      and enterprises to quickly find
       and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications,
       see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of 
       all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category 
       keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots. 
       You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it, 
       configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. </p><p>You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately
       within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the
       AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the
       code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.
       For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs
       GitHub repository.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer
       experiences available:</p><ul>
       <li>
       <p>Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about them, including
       source code and readme files. Also install, configure, and deploy applications of your choosing. </p>
       <p>Publishing Applications – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other
       developers, and publish new versions of applications. </p>

      <p>Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You
      can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from
      cloud, on-premises, and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in
      your Amazon Web Services account. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an
      account management service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web
      Services accounts into an organization that you create and centrally
      manage. With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite
      existing accounts to join your organization. Security Lake helps you
      analyze security data for a more complete understanding of your security
      posture across the entire organization. It can also help you improve the
      protection of your workloads, applications, and data.</p> <p>The data lake
      is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you
      retain ownership over your data.</p> <p>Amazon Security Lake integrates
      with CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a
      user, role, or an Amazon Web Services service. In Security Lake,
      CloudTrail captures API calls for Security Lake as events. The calls
      captured include calls from the Security Lake console and code calls to
      the Security Lake API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable
      continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including
      events for Security Lake. If you don't configure a trail, you can still
      view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history.
      Using the information collected by CloudTrail you can determine the
      request that was made to Security Lake, the IP address from which the
      request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional
      details. To learn more about Security Lake information in CloudTrail, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html">Amazon
      Security Lake User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Security Lake automates the
      collection of security-related log and event data from integrated Amazon
      Web Services and third-party services. It also helps you manage the
      lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings.
      Security Lake converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a
      standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework
      (OCSF).</p> <p>Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can
      subscribe to the data that's stored in Security Lake for incident response
      and security data analytics.</p>

                  Region for either accounts that are part of a trusted
                  organization or standalone accounts. Once you add an Amazon

                  third-party custom sources. After creating the appropriate IAM
                  role to invoke Glue crawler, use this API to add a custom

                  target location for log files from the custom source. In
                  addition, this operation also creates an associated Glue table

                  scoped to an individual account, and are not public. The URL
                  does not contain the account ID, but Amazon SageMaker

                  is a file that contains simulation state data at a specific
                  time. The state data saved in a snapshot includes entity data
                  from the State Fabric, the simulation configuration specified
                  in the schema, and the clock tick number. You can use the

      <p>Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security
      state in Amazon Web Services and helps you assess your Amazon Web Services
      environment against security industry standards and best practices.</p>
      <p>Security Hub collects security data across Amazon Web Services
      accounts, Amazon Web Services, and supported third-party products and
      helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority
      security issues.</p> <p>To help you manage the security state of your
      organization, Security Hub supports multiple security standards. These
      include the Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices
      (FSBP) standard developed by Amazon Web Services, and external compliance
      frameworks such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment
      Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute
      of Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes several
      security controls, each of which represents a security best practice.
      Security Hub runs checks against security controls and generates control
      findings to help you assess your compliance against security best
      practices.</p> <p>In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub
      also receives findings from other Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon
      GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, and supported third-party products. This
      gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related
      issues. You can also send Security Hub findings to other Amazon Web
      Services and supported third-party products.</p> <p>Security Hub offers
      automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues.
      For example, you can use automation rules to automatically update critical
      findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the
      integration with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to
      specific findings.</p> <p>This guide, the <i>Security Hub API
      Reference</i>, provides information about the Security Hub API. This
      includes supported resources, HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas. If
      you're new to Security Hub, you might find it helpful to also review the
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">
      <i>Security Hub User Guide</i> </a>. The user guide explains key concepts
      and provides procedures that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features.
      It also provides information about topics such as integrating Security Hub
      with other Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>In addition to interacting with
      Security Hub by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can use a
      current version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon
      Web Services provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample
      code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go,
      Python, C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient,
      programmatic access to Security Hub and other Amazon Web Services . They
      also handle tasks such as signing requests, managing errors, and retrying
      requests automatically. For information about installing and using the
      Amazon Web Services tools and SDKs, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/">Tools to Build on Amazon Web
      Services</a>.</p> <p>With the exception of operations that are related to
      central configuration, Security Hub API requests are executed only in the
      Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific
      Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any
      configuration or settings change that results from the operation is
      applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions,
      call the same API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the
      change. When you use central configuration, API requests for enabling
      Security Hub, standards, and controls are executed in the home Region and
      all linked Regions. For a list of central configuration operations, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/central-configuration-intro.html#central-configuration-concepts">Central
      configuration terms and concepts</a> section of the <i>Security Hub User
      Guide</i>.</p> <p>The following throttling limits apply to Security Hub
      API operations.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>BatchEnableStandards</code> -
      <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of
      1 request per second.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>GetFindings</code> -

      of 6 requests per second.</p> </li> <li> <p>

      <p>AWS Signer is a fully managed code-signing service to help you ensure
      the trust and integrity of your code. </p> <p>Signer supports the
      following applications:</p> <p>With code signing for AWS Lambda, you can
      sign <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/">AWS Lambda</a>
      deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/">Amazon S3</a>, <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/">Amazon
      CloudWatch</a>, and <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">AWS
      CloudTrail</a>. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and
      then use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3. </p> <p>With code signing
      for IoT, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS.
      IoT code signing is available for <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/">Amazon
      FreeRTOS</a> and <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/">AWS IoT
      Device Management</a>, and is integrated with <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">AWS Certificate
      Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign code, you import a third-party
      code-signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon
      FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management. </p> <p>With Signer and the
      Notation CLI from the <a href="https://notaryproject.dev/">Notary&#x2028;
      Project</a>, you can sign container images stored in a container registry
      such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The signatures are stored
      in the registry alongside the images, where they are available for
      verifying image authenticity and integrity.</p> <p>For more information
      about Signer, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">AWS
      Signer Developer Guide</a>.</p>

      <p>Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console
      designed to help users mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their
      Amazon Web Services-hosted applications. An incident is any unplanned
      interruption or reduction in quality of services. </p> <p>Incident Manager
      increases incident resolution by notifying responders of impact,
      highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration
      tools to get services back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of
      reducing the time-to-resolution of critical incidents, Incident Manager
      automates response plans and enables responder team escalation. </p>

      <fullname>Step Functions</fullname> <p>Step Functions is a service that
      lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and
      microservices using visual workflows.</p> <p>You can use Step Functions to
      build applications from individual components, each of which performs a
      discrete function, or <i>task</i>, allowing you to scale and change
      applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps
      visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step
      Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps
      when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the
      right order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you
      can quickly diagnose and debug any issues.</p> <p>Step Functions manages
      operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is
      available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services, your own
      servers, or any system that has access to Amazon Web Services. You can
      access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services
      SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the
      <i> <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html">Step
      Functions Developer Guide</a> </i>.</p> <important> <p>If you use the Step
      Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK integrations, make
      sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names are in Pascal
      case. For example, you could use Step Functions API action
      <code>startSyncExecution</code> and specify its parameter as
      <code>StateMachineArn</code>.</p> </important>

      <p>IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables
      a client (such as CLI or a native application) to register with IAM
      Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s
      access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM
      Identity Center.</p> <note> <p>IAM Identity Center uses the
      <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces.</p>
      </note> <p> <b>Considerations for Using This Guide</b> </p> <p>Before you
      begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following
      important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service
      works.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently
      implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant
      standard (<a
      href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>)
      that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the CLI.
      </p> </li> <li> <p>With older versions of the CLI, the service only emits
      OIDC access tokens, so to obtain a new token, users must explicitly
      re-authenticate. To access the OIDC flow that supports token refresh and
      doesn’t require re-authentication, update to the latest CLI version
      (1.27.10 for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with support for OIDC token
      refresh and configurable IAM Identity Center session durations. For more
      information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html">Configure
      Amazon Web Services access portal session duration </a>. </p> </li> <li>
      <p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all Amazon
      Web Services account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user,
      not just a particular application.</p> </li> <li> <p>The documentation in
      this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access token
      into Amazon Web Services Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with
      IAM-protected Amazon Web Services service endpoints. For more information,
      see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html">GetRoleCredentials</a>
      in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide</i>.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What
      is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User
      Guide</i>.</p>

      volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing
      to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and
      snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April
      2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your
      systems with the new format. For more information, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">Longer EC2 and EBS
      resource IDs</a>.</p> <p>For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
      with the longer volume ID format looks like the following:</p> <p>
      <code>arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG</code>.</p>

      <p> AWS Supply Chain is a cloud-based application that works with your
      enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management systems.
      Using AWS Supply Chain, you can connect and extract your inventory,
      supply, and demand related data from existing ERP or supply chain systems
      into a single data model. </p> <p>The AWS Supply Chain API supports
      configuration data import for Supply Planning.</p> <p> All AWS Supply
      chain API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They
      not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive
      use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help
      facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. </p>

                description: >-
                  <p>Returns a set of temporary credentials for an Amazon Web
                  Services account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an
                  access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token.
                  Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want to
                  use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific Amazon Web
                  Services API operations like Amazon EC2
                  <code>StopInstances</code>.</p> <p>MFA-enabled IAM users must
                  call <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA code that
                  is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary
                  security credentials that the call returns, IAM users can then
                  make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA
                  authentication. An incorrect MFA code causes the API to return
                  an access denied error. For a comparison of
                  <code>GetSessionToken</code> with the other API operations
                  that produce temporary credentials, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting
                  Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a

                  the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM
                  User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>No permissions are required for
                  users to perform this operation. The purpose of the
                  <code>sts:GetSessionToken</code> operation is to authenticate
                  the user using MFA. You cannot use policies to control
                  authentication operations. For more information, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_getsessiontoken.html">Permissions
                  for GetSessionToken</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
                  </note> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>The
                  <code>GetSessionToken</code> operation must be called by using
                  the long-term Amazon Web Services security credentials of an
                  IAM user. Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid
                  for the duration that you specify. This duration can range
                  from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600
                  seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43,200 seconds (12
                  hours). Credentials based on account credentials can range
                  from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour),
                  with a default of 1 hour. </p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p>
                  <p>The temporary security credentials created by
                  <code>GetSessionToken</code> can be used to make API calls to
                  any Amazon Web Services service with the following
                  exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM API
                  operations unless MFA authentication information is included
                  in the request.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS API
                  <i>except</i> <code>AssumeRole</code> or
                  <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The
                  credentials that <code>GetSessionToken</code> returns are
                  based on permissions associated with the IAM user whose
                  credentials were used to call the operation. The temporary
                  credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user.</p>
                  <note> <p>Although it is possible to call
                  <code>GetSessionToken</code> using the security credentials of
                  an Amazon Web Services account root user rather than an IAM
                  user, we do not recommend it. If <code>GetSessionToken</code>
                  is called using root user credentials, the temporary
                  credentials have root user permissions. For more information,
                  see <a

      Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon
      SWF, a <i>task</i> represents a logical unit of work that is performed by
      a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves
      managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance

      <p><fullname>Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack</fullname> <p>You
      can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage your
      support cases in Slack for your Amazon Web Services account. After you
      configure your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web Services
      Support App, you can perform the following tasks directly in your Slack
      channel:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create, search, update, and resolve your support
      cases</p> </li> <li> <p>Request service quota increases for your
      account</p> </li> <li> <p>Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to
      your channel so that you can chat directly about your support cases</p>
      </li> </ul> <p>For more information about how to perform these actions in
      Slack, see the following documentation in the <i>Amazon Web Services
      Support User Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a

                  </note> <p>A Slack channel can have up to 100 Amazon Web
                  Services accounts. This means that only 100 accounts can add
                  the same Slack channel to the Amazon Web Services Support App.
                  We recommend that you only add the accounts that you need to
                  manage support cases for your organization. This can reduce
                  the notifications about case updates that you receive in the
                  Slack channel.</p> <note> <p>We recommend that you choose a
                  private Slack channel so that only members in that channel
                  have read and write access to your support cases. Anyone in
                  your Slack channel can create, update, or resolve support
                  cases for your account. Users require an invitation to join

                  <p>Enables you to write your time-series data into Timestream.
                  You can specify a single data point or a batch of data points
                  to be inserted into the system. Timestream offers you a
                  flexible schema that auto detects the column names and data
                  types for your Timestream tables based on the dimension names
                  and data types of the data points you specify when invoking
                  writes into the database. </p> <p>Timestream supports eventual
                  consistency read semantics. This means that when you query
                  data immediately after writing a batch of data into
                  Timestream, the query results might not reflect the results of
                  a recently completed write operation. The results may also
                  include some stale data. If you repeat the query request after
                  a short time, the results should return the latest data. <a

                  quotas apply</a>. </p> <p>See <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/code-samples.write.html">code
                  sample</a> for details.</p> <p> <b>Upserts</b> </p> <p>You can
                  use the <code>Version</code> parameter in a
                  <code>WriteRecords</code> request to update data points.
                  Timestream tracks a version number with each record.
                  <code>Version</code> defaults to <code>1</code> when it's not
                  specified for the record in the request. Timestream updates an
                  existing record’s measure value along with its
                  <code>Version</code> when it receives a write request with a
                  higher <code>Version</code> number for that record. When it
                  receives an update request where the measure value is the same
                  as that of the existing record, Timestream still updates
                  <code>Version</code>, if it is greater than the existing value
                  of <code>Version</code>. You can update a data point as many
                  times as desired, as long as the value of <code>Version</code>
                  continuously increases. </p> <p> For example, suppose you
                  write a new record without indicating <code>Version</code> in
                  the request. Timestream stores this record, and set
                  <code>Version</code> to <code>1</code>. Now, suppose you try
                  to update this record with a <code>WriteRecords</code> request
                  of the same record with a different measure value but, like
                  before, do not provide <code>Version</code>. In this case,
                  Timestream will reject this update with a
                  <code>RejectedRecordsException</code> since the updated
                  record’s version is not greater than the existing value of
                  Version. </p> <p>However, if you were to resend the update
                  request with <code>Version</code> set to <code>2</code>,
                  Timestream would then succeed in updating the record’s value,
                  and the <code>Version</code> would be set to <code>2</code>.
                  Next, suppose you sent a <code>WriteRecords</code> request
                  with this same record and an identical measure value, but with
                  <code>Version</code> set to <code>3</code>. In this case,
                  Timestream would only update <code>Version</code> to
                  <code>3</code>. Any further updates would need to send a
                  version number greater than <code>3</code>, or the update
                  requests would receive a <code>RejectedRecordsException</cod

      Amazon Web Services. You can use Verified Permissions to manage
      permissions for your application, and authorize user access based on those
      permissions. Using Verified Permissions, application developers can grant
      access based on information about the users, resources, and requested
      actions. You can also evaluate additional information like group
      membership, attributes of the resources, and session context, such as time
      of request and IP addresses. Verified Permissions manages these
      permissions by letting you create and store authorization policies for
      your applications, such as consumer-facing web sites and enterprise
      business systems.</p> <p>Verified Permissions uses Cedar as the policy
      language to express your permission requirements. Cedar supports both
      role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC)
      authorization models.</p> <p>For more information about configuring,
      administering, and using Amazon Verified Permissions in your applications,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/">Amazon
      Verified Permissions User Guide</a>.</p> <p>For more information about the
      Cedar policy language, see the <a
      href="https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/">Cedar Policy Language Guide</a>.</p>
      <important> <p>When you write Cedar policies that reference principals,
      resources and actions, you can define the unique identifiers used for each
      of those elements. We strongly recommend that you follow these best
      practices:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Use values like universally unique
      identifiers (UUIDs) for all principal and resource identifiers.</b> </p>
      <p>For example, if user <code>jane</code> leaves the company, and you
      later let someone else use the name <code>jane</code>, then that new user
      automatically gets access to everything granted by policies that still
      reference <code>User::"jane"</code>. Cedar can’t distinguish between the
      new user and the old. This applies to both principal and resource
      identifiers. Always use identifiers that are guaranteed unique and never
      reused to ensure that you don’t unintentionally grant access because of
      the presence of an old identifier in a policy.</p> <p>Where you use a UUID
      for an entity, we recommend that you follow it with the // comment
      specifier and the ‘friendly’ name of your entity. This helps to make your
      policies easier to understand. For example: principal ==
      User::"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a1b2-c3d4-EXAMPLE11111", // alice</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive
      information as part of the unique identifier for your principals or
      resources.</b> These identifiers are included in log entries shared in
      CloudTrail trails.</p> </li> </ul> </important> <p>Several operations
      return structures that appear similar, but have different purposes. As new
      functionality is added to the product, the structure used in a parameter
      of one operation might need to change in a way that wouldn't make sense
      for the same parameter in a different operation. To help you understand
      the purpose of each, the following naming convention is used for the
      structures:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Parameter type structures that end in
      <code>Detail</code> are used in <code>Get</code> operations.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>Parameter type structures that end in <code>Item</code> are used
      in <code>List</code> operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parameter type
      structures that use neither suffix are used in the mutating (create and
      update) operations.</p> </li> </ul>

                  attacks in the request body and you want to block the

      <fullname>WAF</fullname> <note> <p>This is the latest version of the
      <b>WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that
      you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the
      versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the
      prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version,
      because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used
      WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF
      resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web
      ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF
      Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.
      </p> <p>For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to
      this version, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">WAF
      Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall
      that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an
      Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application
      Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner
      service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets
      you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services
      resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify,
      such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of
      query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the
      requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom
      response. </p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed
      information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed
      information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html">WAF
      Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed
      in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html">WAF
      endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you
      can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an
      Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an
      AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service,
      or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p> </li> <li> <p>For
      Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for
      US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you
      can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's
      tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
      more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon
      Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF
      API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API
      provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following
      major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and
      regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you
      specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to
      <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You
      can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with
      a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass
      them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF
      places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each
      type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the
      maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>

                description: >-
                  <p>Updates the specified <a>WebACL</a>. While updating a web
                  ACL, WAF provides continuous coverage to the resources that
                  you have associated with the web ACL. </p> <note> <p>This
                  operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that
                  you already have for the web ACL with the ones that you
                  provide to this call. </p> <p>To modify a web ACL, do the
                  following: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Retrieve it by calling
                  <a>GetWebACL</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>Update its settings as
                  needed</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide the complete web ACL
                  specification to this call</p> </li> </ol> </note> <p> A web
                  ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and
                  control web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines
                  what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF
                  applies to requests that match the statement. In the web ACL,
                  you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any
                  request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a
                  web ACL can be a combination of the types <a>Rule</a>,
                  <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate a
                  web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to
                  protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront
                  distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application
                  Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user
                  pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services
                  Verified Access instance. </p> <p> <b>Temporary
                  inconsistencies during updates</b> </p> <p>When you create or
                  change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a
                  small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the
                  resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few
                  seconds to a number of minutes. </p> <p>The following are
                  examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might
                  notice during change propagation: </p> <ul> <li> <p>After you
                  create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource,
                  you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is
                  unavailable. </p> </li> <li> <p>After you add a rule group to
                  a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one
                  area where the web ACL is used and not in another.</p> </li>
                  <li> <p>After you change a rule action setting, you might see
                  the old action in some places and the new action in others.
                  </p> </li> <li> <p>After you add an IP address to an IP set
                  that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be
                  blocked in one area while still allowed in another.</p> </l

      require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of
      AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help facilitate
      access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an
      IAM user to access the WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full

      <p>The Amazon WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p>File Migration: File migration applications are supported for
      users who want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises
      file system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory
      structure, as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as
      modifications to the permissions of files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security:
      Support security applications are supported for users who have additional
      security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API
      actions, along with CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when
      changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the
      necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates
      the policy, the application can also choose to email the user.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are
      supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose
      to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with
      CloudTrail, to replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical
      applications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are
      Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use
      of the Amazon Web Services SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of
      IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
      policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon
      WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the
      entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes,
      but is not limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload
      any file to any user. This allows developers to perform the three use
      cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a
      selective basis using the IAM model.</p> <note> <p>The pricing for Amazon
      WorkDocs APIs varies depending on the API call type for these actions:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p> <code>READ (Get*)</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>WRITE
      (Activate*, Add*, Create*, Deactivate*, Initiate*, Update*)</code> </p>
      </li> <li> <p> <code>LIST (Describe*)</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>DELETE*, CANCEL</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about
      Amazon WorkDocs API pricing, see <a

                  closed. For example, <code>1480615200.090</code> or
                  <code>1.480615200090E9</code>. Specify either an
                  <code>end_time</code> or <code>in_progress</code>.</p> </li>
                  <li> <p> <code>in_progress</code> - Set to <code>true</code>
                  instead of specifying an <code>end_time</code> to record that
                  a segment has been started, but is not complete. Send an
                  in-progress segment when your application receives a request
                  that will take a long time to serve, to trace that the request
                  was received. When the response is sent, send the complete
                  segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.</p> </li> </ul>
                  <p>A <code>trace_id</code> consists of three numbers separated
                  by hyphens. For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979.
                  This includes:</p> <p class="title"> <b>Trace ID Format</b>
                  </p> <ul> <li> <p>The version number, for instance,
                  <code>1</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The time of the original
                  request, in Unix epoch time, in 8 hexadecimal digits. For
                  example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch time is
                  <code>1480615200</code> seconds, or <code>58406520</code> in
                  hexadecimal.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 96-bit identifier for the
                  trace, globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal digits.</p> </li>
                  </ul>
