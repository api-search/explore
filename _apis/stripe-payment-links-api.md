description: >-
  A payment link is a shareable URL that will take your customers to a hosted
  payment page. A payment link can be shared and used multiple times. When a
  customer opens a payment link it will open a new checkout session to render
  the payment page. You can use checkout session events to track payments
  through payment links.
