  API Gateway enables you to provide secure access to your backend services
  through a well-defined REST API that is consistent across all of your
  services, regardless of the service implementation. Clients consume your REST
  APIS to implement standalone apps for a mobile device or tablet, through apps
  running in a browser, or through any other type of app that can make a request
  to an HTTP endpoint.
